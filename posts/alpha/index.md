# The First Step
After a long while of trying to figure out what to do, I've finally bit down the apple and here we are.

I'll be writing down all my observations and experiences while exploring the many games and stories I come across in my journey.
Hopefully it will be useful or entertaining to the ones who decide to read it, even if the primary goal is first for myself.

So this is it. Welcome aboard in this library of a lifetime.

>What is written will not be forgotten.
