# Freedom
Little Monkey was sitting when a distressed Lion approached, pacing back and forth without rest.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"My kingdom is menaced by other prides, internal conflict is brewing, and I need to mediate with nomads in the territory. I don't have a day for myself, they need me to solve their problems, and I can't risk losing my place, but this is excruciating!" said Lion.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Why do you need to take on that responsibility?"

Lion did not answer.
# Peace
Little Monkey was on his way when a ravenous Hyena jumped out of hiding, stopping after seeing her target.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"My family is famished, and we have no other choice but to steal opportunities or feed on remains. The world hates us for it, and we repay it in kind; nobody else but us to help ourselves. There is no way any of us could survive alone any more, it's an open war!" said Hyena.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Is this impossible to reconcile?"

Hyena did not answer.
# Bonds
Little Monkey was in the woods when a grunting Bear passed by, looking displeased by the sight.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"My home is being invaded by distractions, I can't have a moment of peace and quiet. Others are a source of problems, I got wounded because of those. This will slow me down on all the preparations before winter, I wish no one would bother me!" said Bear.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Could you not ask to help for it?"

Bear did not answer.
# Ego
Little Monkey stopped when a hurried Ant crossed the path, almost colliding.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"Some members of the colony didn't uphold their roles and that resulted in a potential menace. We've been sent to fill the hole and dispose of the misfunctioning elements. If we don't hurry this might create an irregularity and put the Queen at risk!" said Ant.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "What about you?"

Ant did not answer.
# Balance
Little Monkey watched as a mocking Crow landed next to him, laughing alone from an untold joke.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"You wouldn't understand, like all the others that ostracized me. They don't like the way I do things so they excluded me, unable to truly accept me for who I am. They don't know what they're missing by being too hard-headed to accept a different point of view!" said Crow.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Does it not apply to you?"

Crow did not answer.
# Courage
Little Monkey stumbled upon a desperate Turtle, trying to hide in her shell.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"I'm afraid to wander outside, I could be attacked at any moment and be devoured! I could trip and fall, a bad landing and I'm stuck on the back, or worse, cracked open! This is really too dangerous, my life is too precious to take those risks!" said Turtle.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Would this not lose more gains than risks?"

Turtle did not answer.
# Pride
Little Monkey was called upon by a fidgeting Hermit Crab, surrounded by a collection of colorful shells.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"I can't decide on which shell to wear, I want to change it because it's already worn out. I hate this body of mine, I have to find something better to show instead. I'm too frail so I have to get a suitable protection, but it has to catch the eye too!" said Hermit Crab.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Are you really in need of it?"

Hermit Crab did not answer.
# Will
Little Monkey saw a desperate Spider skittering about, scavenging for something.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"I'm searching for a gift, anything suitable to present so that I can safely copulate. I'm weak so she'll definitely get rid of me as soon as it's done, but I can't find a good substitute. Maybe I shouldn't bother and go for it, to hell with consequences!" said Spider.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Why is doing it that important?"

Spider did not answer.
# Spirit
Little Monkey heard a chirping Cicada, singing as if her life depended on it.

"What troubles you so?" asked Little Monkey.

"There's no trouble here, I'm giving it my all because that's a natural thing to do! Life is too short to worry about things, might as well spend it having fun! No point in wasting our time on hard work and painful challenges when we all bite the dust in the end!" said Cicada.

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Is there nothing else worth in life other than joy?"

Cicada did not answer.
# Serenity
Little Monkey sat down, lost in thoughts, unable to find peace.

"What troubles me so?" asked Little Monkey.

"I've realized there are many tricky situations that can happen in life, where no easy solution is possible. Thinking about each side provides valid arguments, yet I'm unable to formulate a conclusion. Without good answers, is there simply a lack of answers, only compromises?"

Little Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: "Why am I unable to find answers to my questions?"

Little Monkey did not answer.
