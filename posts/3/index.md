3 is a familiar numeral, be it this symbol or another, its concept is as old as humanity and comes to represent much more.

# The Magic

It's not difficult through a simple [search online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3) to find many uses and meanings from that number which reveal some uniqueness to it.
Mathematicians and physicists will know how essential it can through things like primary colors, the stability of the triangle, the observable dimensions, algebraic quirks, etc...
It's also prevalent in religion, although I won't delve much deeper due to the amount and variations.
All this can give a certain aura to it, and can lead to wonder: why is this number seemingly so important and magical?

# An interpretation

Of course, what I'm going to say is only an interpretation I made of it. Believe me or not.

3 is the basis of knowledge. 1. Discover 2. Understand 3. Master
Then you build on it as each new mastered point becomes a step; it represents the endless pursuit of knowledge, leading you to enlightenment(apotheosis).
123 123 123, 333, or 3 6 9. The squared process of learning is but the first step. It's the basis of all creation.

Since the very beginning, we have used it as calibration when counting, either to or from 3. Subconsciously, it was already a meaningful concept from where everything else birthed from, and even beyond our mind it stays the essence of world rules to evolve.

# Synthesis

In the end, whether or not you give it importance, this number stays as closest to origins/god/perfection and I hope reading this helped broaden a bit your perception of the concept.
The magic is there, only up to us whether we see it or not.
