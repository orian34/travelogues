3 is a familiar numeral, be it this symbol or another, its concept is as old as humanity and comes to represent much more.

# The Magic

It's not difficult through a simple [search online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3) to find many uses and meanings from that number which reveal some uniqueness to it.
Mathematicians and physicists will know how essential it can through things like primary colors, the stability of the triangle, the observable dimensions, algebraic quirks, etc...
It's also prevalent in religion, although I won't delve much deeper due to the amount and variations.
All this can give a certain aura to it, and can lead to wonder: why is this number seemingly so important and magical?

# An interpretation

Of course, what I'm going to say is only an interpretation I made of it. Believe me or not.

3 is the basis of knowledge. 1. Discover 2. Understand 3. Master
Then you build on it as each new mastered point becomes a step; it represents the endless pursuit of knowledge, leading you to enlightenment(apotheosis).
123 123 123, 333, or 3 6 9. The squared process of learning is but the first step. It's the basis of all creation.

Since the very beginning, we have used it as calibration when counting, either to or from 3. Subconsciously, it was already a meaningful concept from where everything else birthed from, and even beyond our mind it stays the essence of world rules to evolve.

# Synthesis

In the end, whether or not you give it importance, this number stays as closest to origins/god/perfection and I hope reading this helped broaden a bit your perception of the concept.
The magic is there, only up to us whether we see it or not.
# Brain
# Randomness
# Free Will
# World Systems
# AI
# Quantum Physics
# Determinism
It is unbearable for our brain to have to reconsider too many beliefs at once, and something that can be proven is not a belief (barring misinterpretations due to beliefs). It is often because it is the hardest to accept that something is real, otherwise disproving (not denial) it isn't difficult.
# Indeterminism
In the end, it doesn't matter whether or not our universe is deterministic or not, because we cannot prove something outside of it. So it's is completely possible to believe this is simply a test tube that a god created for any reason. The important part is that there is no interactions.
###
What is randomness?
Fate, pure chaos, hidden will, causality, coincidences, etc...? We struggle to define it, and our brain doesn't help when we associate elements regardless of correlation.

Free will is influenced by deterministic interactions, causality is opposite of will. Can we really consider ourselves having will when the world works by causality? The biggest question to answer this is in quantum physics; when we figure out the working system, we will have the final key to existence.


Randomness is orphan results, any result that we lack the causes of can be considered random. Our brain's inability (and refusal) to handle every element in a system too big is what creates this randomness.
Being blind to the causes will make any effect happen randomly, but it is through a deterministic approach that we can experiment and slowly uncover parts of the mechanisms hidden underneath.

A system cannot be calculated in its entirety within itself. Because for each element to calculate, at least a new one has to be created.
The part of a system cannot encompass its entirety.

Sentient AI cannot work because it needs to be flawed like the brain to forget and merge information to lower the amount of processing. It needs to work by bias.
Otherwise it cannot function with sentience because a computer works through a determined set of systems.
So not only is it impossible to create, but it is not useful to have. We can already make sentient humans by reproducing, we don't want that sentience for AI, because AI is a tool and it needs to be efficient.
