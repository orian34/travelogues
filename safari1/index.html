Welcome to the Mod Safari! We will be delving deep into the land of mods to find and observe many creations. Now then, follow me as we go in this adventure to find dangers and wonders!</p>

<p>Spotting The Specimen
Appleskin is a mod that will show the hidden information of hunger mechanics, such as exhaustion and saturation. It’s mainly a visual Quality of Life mod that has no direct impact on the game.</p>

<p>Cautious Observation
It does that in three different ways that are complementary :</p>

<p>First, it’ll make the saturation and exhaustion visible on the hunger bar. The saturation being shown as the yellow outline and exhaustion as a semi-transparent black bar behind the actual hunger bar.</p>

<p>The exhaustion bar growing until it reaches full length and consuming saturation/hunger to reset.
It also shows the food values of items that can be eaten when hovering them.</p>

<p>Even visually telling if the food would have a chance to make you sick.
Finally, it directly shows the amount of hunger and saturation you would regain if you were to eat the food currently held.</p>

<p>Flashing in and out the values to be able to discern from the current state.
Interacting Up Close
The mod itself is very simple to use, and requires no additional steps after installing it. It’s quite handy to avoid doing guess work or if you want to optimize your food value returns.</p>

<p>Sorting The Photos
So this one is an easy catch, providing useful information while not being intrusive makes it a main-stay choice in all of your modded adventures!</p>

<p>Now then, I’ll resume my observations and bring you many more specimens to examine in the future! To another amazing day in my search for amazingness - orian34</p>

<p>And that cookie is going to be for me!</p>
