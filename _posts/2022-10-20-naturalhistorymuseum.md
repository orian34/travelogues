# Presentation


# Overview
started in a forest, welcome to leaf town, there's a lot to prepare for the museum to be ready. It begins humbly, I have to learn how to make tools similarly to tinkers but using blueprints directly.
I set up a base camp and mine a bit finish the first quest. To my surprise, there are gigantic lava lake caves under my spot, this makes it easier to find the rarer ores.
There are interesting spawners everywhere in the deep caves that summon a wave of enemies to defeat, using the spoils I start the trees branch, but ultimately find out I will need a lot more badges first.
Some improvements in my camp for production allow me to begin setting the foundations for the museum, and waiting for the stone to cook I finally find enough diamonds to upgrade my mining strength.
Things will get serious now that I can get obsidian to make a transmutation table. But first is a trip to the nether for glowstone, then everything is in place for the great alchemy! I burn every item with EMC then upgrade my tools with the best materials. This huge step done, I start setting up space for the museum during a long while.
I relocate some necessities in the entrance staff-only area and alter my tablet to be portable. Things are moving now, quite literally! Progress is made easier and I gain access to a handful of useful tools, along with enchanting to boost my gear. Now that my tools self repair for free, I continue the terraforming and begin completing the live trees exhibits. This leads to my very first expedition to gather samples and a good way to map out the terrain around the museum.
Reaching a dead lock for the remaining unlocked displays, I have no option but to continue the set up questline, using the power of flight it's quite simple to raid the nether of all the needed resources. I don't even have to bother with mob farming thanks to the farm blocks!
While this is running, I prepare a set of supremium armor and tools, waiting only on some extra enchantments before using them. I realize I can simply grow a giant pine tree to get the long needed podzol, and this sets off the peat generation for power. It's mostly to make some crystals, but this is a good step nonetheless. I also try out the premade museum schematic, but realize I prefer keeping on doing my open air parc(I wish we had wands though).
As things progress, there are more and more things getting stuck at reaching the End part, so I clear up the rest first. It is time for another gigantic expedition, using waystones found on the way, gathering all the needed blossom saplings and some more things.
Doing this paid back enough badges so I can open a new line in the quests! I had most of the other trees so I clear all the rows in a flash, with only a few harder to find(notably the maple tree which I ended up finding more easily in the giant taiga). All the trees done, it's time to branch off to flowers and plants!
A very long time later, many hours exploring and I can say with certainty candleberries don't drop, damnit. I hate having to do it, but to exceptional situation, exceptional measures - it didn't even have an EMC value so it was strictly impossible to obtain. A quick magic trick and we can finish the gigantic list of crops.

# Conclusion
too much dumped at once?
quest book clunky
not a fan of the ultimate book, defeats the point of searching for the specimens
