# Presentation
Enigmatica 2 Expert is an elaborate Minecraft modpack with a push towards tech while keeping the grind fair(for an expert pack).

Important to specify that I finished playing it a year ago, and after some events lost the old walkthrough post along the previous blog place, so this is a retell of a recent story before it is forgotten.
