# Presentation
Skyopolis 4 is a skyblock modpack with a unique spin on resource progression.

That's the first modpack I played in 1.16, so I get to discover many new mods and features in old mods, exciting!
# Overview
### Back to the Roots
Starting on an unfamiliar sky island, the last time I ended up like this was a prickly situation(maybe one day I'll talk about it). Nothing that scary this time around, it's easy getting the basic resources down and I started expanding a platform.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/a1.png "The quest fest begins.")
I grew it big enough to start having mobs appear on the border, and I planted a field of various seeds for food. Shops and water filtering set up, I can begin gathering many resources.
I hate those rats that keep spawning and eating my crops... I should light up but I don't want to prevent mob spawning yet, grr.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/a2.png "I got visited by a trader and I "gained" some leather from it...")
First tab cleared, Create is next but first I have to set up a basic mana production for Botania. I got lucky from lootboxes and obtained a chest with a big amount of trees. That definitely increased my progress in the different plants I could grow and all the resources available to me.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/a3.png "Feels like paradise much?")
Next step is to delve into Create to make a mill and mixer to make lava. That's the first time I ever used that mod, so it takes me some time to understand how to even make it work. With the cobblestone generator, I'm finally able to get relieved of this side of production.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/a4.png "Uuuh, why won't this work!")
### Ratting it Out
Right, I forgot to tell you something important: unlike other skyblocks, this one gets you ore through throwing stone/dust into liquids. While obtaining some new materials from dust, I worked on automating basic resources through rats... when they deign listening. That's another mod I never used before, so it takes some adaptation.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/b1.png "Lord of the Rats.")
I tried using a rat to make a mob farm but it didn't prove efficient when it made the game crash after a while(not to mention it barely worked). I sealed off the dark room and contented myself of having 2 farmer rats and 1 fisherman. Upgrading my liquid to the nether variant, I'm able to get a slew of new resources and even gold!
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/b2.png "Coal is a rare luxury these days.")
With the gold, I made an ankh and used a blaze rod to make weakness potions through alchemy. I started hunting during the night to get zombie villagers and managed to cure 2, but they don't want to do any trade, oh no. This is a problem, I guess I can't use villagers, huh... Meanwhile, I extracted slime balls to make a mob farm through vector plates, I only have wither plates so it doesn't do much but it'll be efficient soon.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/b3.png "Ohohoho, luck hath smileth upon me. Precious orechid...")
Coming back from a pause, I realized the new villagers need me to give them their job, I forgot that was a thing in the new versions, duh. Through the trades, I became able to mine iron and all the other ores with an emerald pickaxe. I guess I ended up bypassing the progression gates... Oopsie ;P
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/b4.png "Live-wired pole, the return of the great wall.")
### Trick Ore Treat
Thanks to the orechid, I obtained the diamond needed for the duplicating ore rat upgrade and am now twice as efficient! With all this iron, I finally could make good plates in my mob farm, and it now works finely. I set up a whole lot more rats automation and was able to get new liquids for resources.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/c1.png "Progress sometimes flows unpredictably.")
Then I made some beehives and bought iron bees through the shop, but things went wrong and they already accidently died when I tried moving the hives. I'm really not familiar with those, ugh.
Since I lost my precious bees, I went and made an anvil for a Create press, allowing me to make plates efficiently. Next step is the Immersive Engineering press for the wire mold, the era of machines is upon us!
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/c2.png "Scamming the system.")
After some afterschool research, I set up some automatic bee farms, although empty for now. In prevision for that, I build the metal press and a windmill to power it. While it's idle, I also power the centrifuge to extract the combs from my newly bought coal bees. Bit by bit the setup to gain annoying resources is on!
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/c3.png "Doing my job, even stranded away.")
I fight and defeat apotheic bosses despite not having good weapons, and obtain some mending books through tomb disenchanting. I continue growing my bee farm and alternate with making some runes while mana fills up. I'm not afraid of it running out now that I have unlimited coal supplies... My bee farm is getting a bit out of hands with so much surplus it's starting to clog the centrifuges.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/c4.png "Diamondzzzzz.")
### Fairies' Gold
All the accumulated mana was enough to get terrasteel and to open the portal as well. I upgraded my mana setup, although now I'm starting to run low on ender pearls. After some mental work, I managed to setup an automation of the mana production and made all the runes. Then I installed a crafting process for the ultimate rune almost hands free, allowing me to get unlimited sky bucks, I'm rich!!!
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/d1.png "Free bucks if you follow this link.")
After that, I upgraded my liquid to the ore producing version, this will come in handy. Due to my system, I already obtained the challenge of making a stack of ultimate runes, heh. I used all those bucks to buy an uncrafting bench, we never know when that could be useful.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/d2.png "M-ores.")
I managed to unclog my centrifuge processing by adding a few more, things are smooth sailing now. It's time to prepare my hemp field for powering the next IE machines I have to build. But first, it's gaia time! It's unsurprisingly very easy, but I expected that in a crafting pack. After a few rematches, I upgrade my gear one last time using the loot, and it's time to close the botania chapter for now.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/d3.png "I'm the conductor of this orchestra.")
I direly need storage now, I don't have any centralization and I have to move things manually. Looking at the tech tree, I'll need to do pneumaticraft next, so here I go.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/d4.png "Off with your head!")
### Under Pressure
Starting with a pressure chamber, I hit an immovable wall... I need to make liquid plastic first, and to make it I need either the full distillation tower, or biofuel. Tactical retreat for now, I focus on one machine at a time, using rats for easier handling of supplying.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/e1.png "Combing my needs.")
I still severely lack power options and making windmills is tiring. Thankfully despite being slow, my new arc furnace still runs and I'm able to make the next tier of machines with the casings it makes. I setup an automatic lava production as an ace in the hole for a magmatic dynamo and craft some extra stirling ones. It's time to look into the next tier of technology...
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/e2.png "Seconds before disaster. Don't do that at home.")
I start by setting up some low cost machines with unsupplied stirling dynamos for bursts of power. Thankfully, most of the machines aren't necessary but I make a sawmill for better wood efficiency and after struggling a bit to get packed ice, I craft the blast chiller hooked to my lava production for easier obsidian. With this, I can finally begin putting ender chests and tanks to every machine outputs so I can centralize all the production easily. With some manually-made bitumen, I obtain the much needed plastic through erosion liquid.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/e3.png "Life is potato.")
I set up an UV lightbox to start preparing my PCBs and while waiting for it I build a refinery that is easily supplied through my new ender system. I now have all the biofuel I wanted and more! 4 buckets of acid later, my circuit boards are now etching nicely and another big step of progress gone through. I took some time while the remaining resources needed were being produced to expand a bit my centrifuge factory and hives. Once everything is ready, I build the assembly line, it is time for the processors...
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/e4.png "Vacuum over void.")
### Beegital Era
I automatize it to the most I can, and then I start setting up the controller and the necessary utilities. My final storage is shaping up! With only a meager 1k of data available, I first make a 64k disk, with some basic patterns to facilitate it. Unlimited spaaaaaace, I was able to move all my wall of chests and my mob farm loot into the disk, I love technology. Crafting never has been easier, but it can get better with wireless.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/f1.png "Goodbye wall of chests.")
First is going to be stabilizing my autocrafting system and power supply. I'll have to look into flux networks for ease of transport, but it looks like I need to delve more into Create... Except it seems like I'm already throttled in power, so I set up an upgraded energy cell with several dynamos always running to ensure it's always on. This will give me some leeway until I clear out the rest. Aah, did I miss refined storage, it feels so good and convenient to use but damn does it wear on the power grid now!
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/f2.png "Hello my old friend.")
Did a bit of research and figured out the best thing I should do is a giant windmill to power up my mechanical crafters, quite simple in the end. It's pretty neat, and now I can make the crushing wheels that waited all this time. It was trickier that I thought to set them up at first, then I remembered about the gearbox... This Create mod is growing more and more on me I'll admit, it's fun and efficient.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/f3.png "The crushing wheel of progress is unstoppable.")
Anyway, next step is making the flux powder to then have access to the great flux network! My priority is the wireless charger, I hook it up to my cell and add an antenna to my storage controller. I have access to my whole storage anywhere around, hahahahaha... yeah, the range sucks. I don't wait long to make the range upgrades, and I even push a bit to make the creative range upgrade and install it, yes!
... Yeah, I didn't expect it to drain 16K RF per tick, oh dear what? Guess I'll make another set of normal range upgrades for now.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/f4.png "What a fool I was...")
### Stuck in the Web
This settled, I will expend my data space with a higher end disk, but I need more materials. That means it's time for processing automation! My favorite part of the mod. I begin by increasing the amount of beehives I have, and adding a lot more mixers to provide a high supply of lava to the magmatic dynamo. This should be a good buffer for the interfaces I'll have to support... and that's when I figured I did all that for naught, as the magmatic dynamo is the same efficiency as the stirling one except it's a ton more annoying to supply. I regret it now.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/g1.png "How terribly disappointing.")
At least, I figured out I could upgrade my dynamos for a higher output. Thanks to my bees, I have all the alloys effortlessly. And now I have a greatly increased power supply, no more issues although still far from being able to support creative range. I started making a 1024K data disk to solve my space issues, and meanwhile I used some blank eggs to get rare spawn eggs.
Ok, it's really taking forever to do the processors, so I went and shut down my mob farm as I'm getting dangerously close to data cap, and the endermen teleporting and wrecking my base every night were terribly annoying.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/g2.png "Another rat bites the dust.")
That's when tragedy strikes... I was 10 processors close to finishing the crafting, and it got deleted for reaching data cap. All the resources gone, this is maddening but I'm also stuck for data, damnit damnit damnit! I quickly make 2 extra 64K disks and then with my awesome autocrafting, I make a dozen more thermogenerators all hooked to my centrifuges. I finally offset the bee production and I negated the permanent power burden.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modpack/sky4/g3.png "Don't catch a cold in this hot mess")
I restart some processor crafting while setting up a beecon made up from uncrafted purpur blocks. I don't have chaurus flowers yet, but this'll be handy for later. Solid power, autocrafting underway, good resources supplying without throttle from bees. I've reached the era of prosperity it seems, like a big chapter has been completed. Now the only thing left is to produce some crude oil and refine fuel to explore the nether.
