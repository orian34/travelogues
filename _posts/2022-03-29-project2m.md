# Presentation
Project 2M is a full length [CTM](https://orian34.github.io/travelogues/ctm/) map. It is hard and open world.

I'm very squeamish about playing hard maps, since I'm not a fan usually, but I heard enough praise that I decided to try it myself.
# Overview
### White

The start is harsh. Better not fall into the void with the starting wood or you can reset. The campfire is confusing with no explanations, but it becomes fairly obvious once you reach another one.
The struggle with wooden gear is real, but aside archers, it's all manageable.

Not a fan of having tanky ranged skeletons this early. Natural spawns are always a nuisance, but it's especially bad here.
### Orange
Mean traps and daunting combat, but wood and cool are plentiful here and there's even a good amount of stone. Ups and downs on the ledge is a bit stressful, but it's rewarding a whole new gear tier.
The giant cavern is looking like a big intersection, and finding the second objective this soon is a relief. That means areas aren't super massive and are finely segmented even in the same space.

Since you emerge low of resources, there's a big chance you'll tackle this area second as you go mine to suit up for the danger ahead. Smart placement.
### Magenta
Really tense and dangerous, felt like walking the tightrope. The kind of areas only hard maps would make, it was refreshing and great.

Not as deadly as it looks to be... as long as you don't let a creeper blow up a tnt stack.
### Gray
After this point, that's where people will likely spread out in the progression, as you get a whopping 7 possible areas to go to. I chose to go to the mineshaft area since it was closest and seemed to contain good resources.

The start is filled with trigger happy wipe traps but thankfully calms down later. The mobs on the other hand are very unassuming but easily kill you in 2-3 hits with full chain armor. I thought they were overtuned until I got the objective, which made sense since it's what would be considered the halfway point of the map. Lovely suspended bridges area.

The iron nugget ore is very smart and a good way of having armor progression feel more natural(even though I completely skipped leather and gold I guess).
### Yellow
After the previous mistake, I tried tackling the easiest looking area, and it wasn't too far off the mark. I'm not surprised it wasn't light blue, considering how yellow everything looked.

It was fun and balanced overall, the complaint would be that there was so much damn natural spawns, it burned all my gear and resources.

A good experience of why I don't like natural spawns and how annoying they can be. It didn't help that the whole top of the temple is a waste of time with so much fighting for a stick.
### Light Blue
While the color is similar, it's not very intuitive to have an early area with nether blocks as it's usually ominous.

This place is basically an exacerbation of yellow's natural spawn issues due to the terrible vegetation. If clogging your inventory and annoyingly disrupting combat was a boss, this would be it.
The fun parts at the end got doused after triggering an unfair wipe trap.
### Pink
The looks of a final area, complete with a midway checkpoint, but it's actually just the 7th area. Probably the best area so far, with magenta being close.
It's fun and dangerous, with lots of ranged enemies, but nothing really mean.

Some pretty good items in the few chests to loot. The layout made natural spawns more reasonable and likely helped in making it the best experience. Oh, and the heart coral blocks slowly decaying really help sell the "killing the beast" feel.
### Lime
Pretty fun, clean castle conquest area. The illusioner spawners were a bit overkill, when 4 spawned at once I just left.
### ?

# Conclusion

The mobs are fairly numerous and tanky, but their damage is reasonable even without armor at the start(barring some exceptions).
There is the right amount of forgiveness in resource renewal... if you don't count the many mean wipe traps. You have to learn to manage your resources to go far here.

Globally, the natural spawns are the main annoyance, due to low visibility and lots of space to light up. They're too disruptive at times to be enjoyable, they're not bad but I'll still prefer Horrifeye spawns for a hard type map.

The open world aspect is top notch, with lots of options available and only surviving to guide you.

It is a hard and mean map, but as long as you can stand back from an offset, then you'll find a great experience here.
