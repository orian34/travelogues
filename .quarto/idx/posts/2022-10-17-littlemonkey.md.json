I don't have a day for myself, they need me to solve their problems, and I can't risk losing my place, but this is excruciating!\" said Lion.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Why do you need to take on that responsibility?\"\n\nLion did not answer.\n# Peace\nLittle Monkey was on his way when a ravenous Hyena jumped out of hiding, stopping after seeing her target.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"My family is famished, and we have no other choice but to steal opportunities or feed on remains. The world hates us for it, and we repay it in kind; nobody else but us to help ourselves. There is no way any of us could survive alone any more, it's an open war!\" said Hyena.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Is this impossible to reconcile?\"\n\nHyena did not answer.\n# Bonds\nLittle Monkey was in the woods when a grunting Bear passed by, looking displeased by the sight.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"My home is being invaded by distractions, I can't have a moment of peace and quiet. Others are a source of problems, I got wounded because of those. This will slow me down on all the preparations before winter, I wish no one would bother me!\" said Bear.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Could you not ask to help for it?\"\n\nBear did not answer.\n# Ego\nLittle Monkey stopped when a hurried Ant crossed the path, almost colliding.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"Some members of the colony didn't uphold their roles and that resulted in a potential menace. We've been sent to fill the hole and dispose of the misfunctioning elements. If we don't hurry this might create an irregularity and put the Queen at risk!\" said Ant.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"What about you?\"\n\nAnt did not answer.\n# Balance\nLittle Monkey watched as a mocking Crow landed next to him, laughing alone from an untold joke.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand, like all the others that ostracized me. They don't like the way I do things so they excluded me, unable to truly accept me for who I am. They don't know what they're missing by being too hard-headed to accept a different point of view!\" said Crow.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Does it not apply to you?\"\n\nCrow did not answer.\n# Courage\nLittle Monkey stumbled upon a desperate Turtle, trying to hide in her shell.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"I'm afraid to wander outside, I could be attacked at any moment and be devoured! I could trip and fall, a bad landing and I'm stuck on the back, or worse, cracked open! This is really too dangerous, my life is too precious to take those risks!\" said Turtle.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Would this not lose more gains than risks?\"\n\nTurtle did not answer.\n# Pride\nLittle Monkey was called upon by a fidgeting Hermit Crab, surrounded by a collection of colorful shells.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"I can't decide on which shell to wear, I want to change it because it's already worn out. I hate this body of mine, I have to find something better to show instead. I'm too frail so I have to get a suitable protection, but it has to catch the eye too!\" said Hermit Crab.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Are you really in need of it?\"\n\nHermit Crab did not answer.\n# Will\nLittle Monkey saw a desperate Spider skittering about, scavenging for something.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"I'm searching for a gift, anything suitable to present so that I can safely copulate. I'm weak so she'll definitely get rid of me as soon as it's done, but I can't find a good substitute. Maybe I shouldn't bother and go for it, to hell with consequences!\" said Spider.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Why is doing it that important?\"\n\nSpider did not answer.\n# Spirit\nLittle Monkey heard a chirping Cicada, singing as if her life depended on it.\n\n\"What troubles you so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"There's no trouble here, I'm giving it my all because that's a natural thing to do! Life is too short to worry about things, might as well spend it having fun! No point in wasting our time on hard work and painful challenges when we all bite the dust in the end!\" said Cicada.\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Is there nothing else worth in life other than joy?\"\n\nCicada did not answer.\n# Serenity\nLittle Monkey sat down, lost in thoughts, unable to find peace.\n\n\"What troubles me so?\" asked Little Monkey.\n\n\"I've realized there are many tricky situations that can happen in life, where no easy solution is possible. Thinking about each side provides valid arguments, yet I'm unable to formulate a conclusion. Without good answers, is there simply a lack of answers, only compromises?\"\n\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: \"Why am I unable to find answers to my questions?\"\n\nLittle Monkey did not answer.\n\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"orian34/travelogues\"\n        issue-term=\"title\"\n        label=\"Comment\"\n        theme=\"github-dark\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"2022-10-17-littlemonkey.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"dark":"darkly","light":"flatly"},"title-block-banner":true,"layout":"post","description":"Collection of stories from an unknown author.","categories":["story"],"title":"Little Monkey"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
