    "title": "Systems - The Mind and the World",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are many systems ruling our universe, and piling upon each other, they make new ones ever increasingly. Whether it is particles, concepts, processes, is it all part of the same root and would it be possible to draw connections?\nTo make it very clear, I am no physicist, doctor, or have any other kind of qualifications, so it is entirely your choice to decide how credible what will follow is.\n\nRandomness\nTo begin with, what is randomness? Fate, chaos, hidden will, causality, coincidences, etc…? We struggle to define it, and our brain doesn’t help when we associate elements regardless of correlation.\nIt can be seen everywhere in appearance, such as the exact time to reach a destination, if you will see a bird fly above, what you feel depending on the day, what faces the dice will show, you could make a case for everything. But mirrored to that, it is possible to deduce fairly accurate outcomes for the same situations depending on the information we can access.\nAnother case of randomness is in computers, with Random Number Generators. While we call them random, we know exactly how they work, by taking very volatile information that is considered pseudo-random enough.\nWhat we can infer from all this is that randomness is orphan results, any result that we lack the causes of can be considered random. Our brain’s inability (and refusal) to handle every element in a system too big is what creates this randomness.\nBeing blind to the causes will make any effect happen randomly, but it is through a deterministic approach that we can experiment and slowly uncover parts of the mechanisms hidden underneath. Free will is influenced by deterministic interactions, causality is opposite of will. Can we really consider ourselves having a will when the world works by causality?\nThe biggest question to answer this is in quantum physics; when we figure out the working system, we will have the final key to existence.\n\n\nQuantum Physics\nThere is a lot of research in that domain because it’s such a difficult yet important matter to solve. My uncultured opinion on it is that we’re fundamentally mistaking quantum physics because of the concepts. We have to measure statistically because it’s physically impossible currently to get the quantum values at our level, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist, just like for randomness.\nSo having possibility waves as basis is something I have trouble accepting. The very crux of this problem is that a probabilistic system creates uncertainty, while I think it’s caused by the (current) impossibility to have measurements without collapsing the wave function. But I am deeply convinced that this is a deterministic system.\nSo it’s not that a particle is a cloud of positions, but that we’re unable to have its values (until measured), leading to an outcome similar to a probabilistic system. That’s the whole meaning behind randomness, which is anything with unknown causes and known results. Anything that has unknown causes for a known result will be random to the relative perception of it.\nAnd while more simple things can be figured out with lower effort (like wind making a leaf fall when the applied force becomes stronger than the linking force), quantum variables are so difficult to obtain without measuring, that we become “forced” to consider them random because finding the causes is absurdly troublesome.\nCausality isn’t a rule you can break, it’s how the world works. If something breaks causality, it’s because we missed something to explain it. Maybe there be an infinitesimal particle that forms every system, making it a unitary actor to all that is currently unexplainable.\n\n\nSystems\nAnother part that really rubs me wrong is when hypothesis mention different dimensions/universes. It’s often used as an example to go from perception of 1D, to 2D, 3D etc and that a lower one can’t perceive the higher dimension. But there’s a big logical fallacy to it; those dimensions are conceptual, in reality they do not apply, they’re useful as tools but aren’t the pattern.\nWe live in one dimension with all the various variables, and there’s no going in higher or lower dimensions aside from conceptually. The most important point from this is that there is no interaction beyond this dimension to explain all of it(even if we’re missing some parts currently), it’s self contained. So even if you wanted to conceptualize more dimensions, they wouldn’t matter for here.\nLike a bubble, it’s all dependent in being enclosed, and any kind of external pressure would pop the universe (slowly or not) through a leakage disrupting all the systems. In the same way, a system cannot be calculated in its entirety within itself. Because for each unitary element to calculate, at least a new one has to be created and infinity is only a concept, not a reality in our finite world.\nThe part of a system cannot encompass its entirety. An omniscient god cannot be part of the universe.\n\n\nIndeterminism\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter whether or not our universe is deterministic, because we cannot prove something outside of it at the risk of total collapse. So it’s completely possible to believe this is simply a test world that a god created for any reason. The important part is that there is no interactions possible, so it is an impossible question to answer.\nIt is unbearable for our brain to have to reconsider too many beliefs at once, and something that can be proven is not a belief (barring misinterpretations due to beliefs) but a conviction. It is often because it’s the hardest to accept that this something may be real, otherwise disproving (not denial) it isn’t difficult.\nEven though some results seem to hint a true randomness, we still have to use solid values to use any of it, so in the end we’re still bound by causality.\n\n\nAI\nIn the same line of thinking, there are a lot of fantasies about being able to create a thinking AI, yet we’re still unable to fully grasp the way bodies and brains work in the deep details. Sentient AI cannot work because it needs to be flawed like the brain to forget and merge information to lower the amount of processing.\nIt needs to work by bias, otherwise it cannot function with sentience because a computer works through a determined set of systems. And the closer we make it to sentience, the more it will become limited by the same issues we have to face with bias, mental trickery, false impressions and memory alteration.\nSo not only is it impossible to create fully, but it is not useful to have. We can already make sentient humans by reproducing, we don’t want that sentience for AI, because AI is a tool and it needs to be efficient. There is a major hardware and conceptual limitation to have reliable efficiency while also having a self reflecting behavior for constant change.\n\n\nProgress\nWhat can be said in the end? Maybe most of what I said (if not all) is simply bogus, and new research will prove how wrong I was. Maybe it is in the right direction, and new advances in difficult domains will happen, proving it.\nWith certainty, things will change, even if it is undetermined for now."

    "section": "",
    "text": "CTM stands for Complete The Monument, and originated from quite a long time ago.\nThey are Minecraft maps where you have to complete a monument as a goal. It started with having to obtain 16 wool blocks in their respective areas and placing them in a monument, but is now declined in various ways. It doesn’t have to be items, nor does it need to have a solid monument to complete. There are even some CTMs made in other games; At this point it is simply a genre of doing something with a goal to accomplish.\nBut the most common ones stay in a fairly standard format with global rules. You’ll be playing in Survival Mode, with no cheating and variable rules. The rest is usually fair game, using what you’re given the way you want.\nThe more modern maps have a tendency to become closer to action adventure with customized gear and enemies, capitalizing on datapacks for even more elaborate mechanics. There are as many styles as there are mapmakers and the diversity makes it truly a unique genre.\nThe best place to find them is the CTM repository. Maintained and containing most of all the CTM maps ever made.\nThe document I maintain with all the maps I reviewed.\nThere is also a discord server for the CTM community to share and talk about CTM maps."

    "title": "Walking Through Skyopolis 4",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Modpack Author: benbenlaw\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.16.5 - Pack = 13.0\n\n\nPresentation\nSkyopolis 4 is a skyblock modpack with a unique spin on resource progression.\nThat’s the first modpack I play in 1.16, so I get to discover many new mods and features in old mods, exciting! Welcome to Aerlund.\n\n\nOverview\n\nBack to the Roots\nStarting on an unfamiliar sky island, the last time I ended up like this was a prickly situation(maybe one day I’ll talk about it). Nothing that scary this time around, it’s easy getting the basic resources down and I started expanding a platform.\n\n\n\nThe quest fest begins.\n\n\nI grew it big enough to start having mobs appear on the border, and I planted a field of various seeds for food. Shops and water filtering set up, I can begin gathering many resources. I hate those rats that keep spawning and eating my crops… I should light up but I don’t want to prevent mob spawning yet, grr.\n\n\n\nI got visited by a trader and I “gained” some leather from it…\n\n\nFirst tab cleared, Create is next but first I have to set up a basic mana production for Botania. I got lucky from lootboxes and obtained a chest with a big amount of trees. That definitely increased my progress in the different plants I could grow and all the resources available to me.\n\n\n\nFeels like paradise much?\n\n\nNext step is to delve into Create to make a mill and mixer to make lava. That’s the first time I ever used that mod, so it takes me some time to understand how to even make it work. With the cobblestone generator, I’m finally able to get relieved of this side of production.\n\n\n\nUuuh, why won’t this work!\n\n\n\n\nRatting it Out\nRight, I forgot to tell you something important: unlike other skyblocks, this one gets you ore through throwing stone/dust into liquids. While obtaining some new materials from dust, I worked on automating basic resources through rats… when they deign listening. That’s another mod I never used before, so it takes some adaptation.\n\n\n\nLord of the Rats.\n\n\nI tried using a rat to make a mob farm but it didn’t prove efficient when it made the game crash after a while(not to mention it barely worked). I sealed off the dark room and contented myself of having 2 farmer rats and 1 fisherman. Upgrading my liquid to the nether variant, I’m able to get a slew of new resources and even gold!\n\n\n\nCoal is a rare luxury these days.\n\n\nWith the gold, I made an ankh and used a blaze rod to make weakness potions through alchemy. I started hunting during the night to get zombie villagers and managed to cure 2, but they don’t want to do any trade, oh no. This is a problem, I guess I can’t use villagers, huh… Meanwhile, I extracted slime balls to make a mob farm through vector plates, I only have wither plates so it doesn’t do much but it’ll be efficient soon.\n\n\n\nOhohoho, luck hath smileth upon me. Precious orechid…\n\n\nComing back from a pause, I realized the new villagers need me to give them their job, I forgot that was a thing in the new versions, duh. Through the trades, I became able to mine iron and all the other ores with an emerald pickaxe. I guess I ended up bypassing the progression gates… Oopsie ;P\n\n\n\nLive-wired pole, the return of the great wall.\n\n\n\n\nTrick Ore Treat\nThanks to the orechid, I obtained the diamond needed for the duplicating ore rat upgrade and am now twice as efficient! With all this iron, I finally could make good plates in my mob farm, and it now works finely. I set up a whole lot more rats automation and was able to get new liquids for resources.\n\n\n\nProgress sometimes flows unpredictably.\n\n\nThen I made some beehives and bought iron bees through the shop, but things went wrong and they already accidently died when I tried moving the hives. I’m really not familiar with those, ugh. Since I lost my precious bees, I went and made an anvil for a Create press, allowing me to make plates efficiently. Next step is the Immersive Engineering press for the wire mold, the era of machines is upon us!\n\n\n\nScamming the system.\n\n\nAfter some afterschool research, I set up some automatic bee farms, although empty for now. In prevision for that, I build the metal press and a windmill to power it. While it’s idle, I also power the centrifuge to extract the combs from my newly bought coal bees. Bit by bit the setup to gain annoying resources is on!\n\n\n\nDoing my job, even stranded away.\n\n\nI fight and defeat apotheic bosses despite not having good weapons, and obtain some mending books through tomb disenchanting. I continue growing my bee farm and alternate with making some runes while mana fills up. I’m not afraid of it running out now that I have unlimited coal supplies… My bee farm is getting a bit out of hands with so much surplus it’s starting to clog the centrifuges.\n\n\n\nDiamondzzzzz.\n\n\n\n\nFairies’ Gold\nAll the accumulated mana was enough to get terrasteel and to open the portal as well. I upgraded my mana setup, although now I’m starting to run low on ender pearls. After some mental work, I managed to setup an automation of the mana production and made all the runes. Then I installed a crafting process for the ultimate rune almost hands free, allowing me to get unlimited sky bucks, I’m rich!!!\n\n\n\nFree bucks if you follow this link.\n\n\nAfter that, I upgraded my liquid to the ore producing version, this will come in handy. Due to my system, I already obtained the challenge of making a stack of ultimate runes, heh. I used all those bucks to buy an uncrafting bench, we never know when that could be useful.\n\n\n\nM-ores.\n\n\nI managed to unclog my centrifuge processing by adding a few more, things are smooth sailing now. It’s time to prepare my hemp field for powering the next IE machines I have to build. But first, it’s gaia time! It’s unsurprisingly very easy, but I expected that in a crafting pack. After a few rematches, I upgrade my gear one last time using the loot, and it’s time to close the botania chapter for now.\n\n\n\nI’m the conductor of this orchestra.\n\n\nI direly need storage now, I don’t have any centralization and I have to move things manually. Looking at the tech tree, I’ll need to do pneumaticraft next, so here I go.\n\n\n\nOff with your head!\n\n\n\n\nUnder Pressure\nStarting with a pressure chamber, I hit an immovable wall… I need to make liquid plastic first, and to make it I need either the full distillation tower, or biofuel. Tactical retreat for now, I focus on one machine at a time, using rats for easier handling of supplying.\n\n\n\nCombing my needs.\n\n\nI still severely lack power options and making windmills is tiring. Thankfully despite being slow, my new arc furnace still runs and I’m able to make the next tier of machines with the casings it makes. I setup an automatic lava production as an ace in the hole for a magmatic dynamo and craft some extra stirling ones. It’s time to look into the next tier of technology…\n\n\n\nSeconds before disaster. Don’t do that at home.\n\n\nI start by setting up some low cost machines with unsupplied stirling dynamos for bursts of power. Thankfully, most of the machines aren’t necessary but I make a sawmill for better wood efficiency and after struggling a bit to get packed ice, I craft the blast chiller hooked to my lava production for easier obsidian. With this, I can finally begin putting ender chests and tanks to every machine outputs so I can centralize all the production easily. With some manually-made bitumen, I obtain the much needed plastic through erosion liquid.\n\n\n\nLife is potato.\n\n\nI set up an UV lightbox to start preparing my PCBs and while waiting for it I build a refinery that is easily supplied through my new ender system. I now have all the biofuel I wanted and more! 4 buckets of acid later, my circuit boards are now etching nicely and another big step of progress gone through. I took some time while the remaining resources needed were being produced to expand a bit my centrifuge factory and hives. Once everything is ready, I build the assembly line, it is time for the processors…\n\n\n\nVacuum over void.\n\n\n\n\nBeegital Era\nI automatize it to the most I can, and then I start setting up the controller and the necessary utilities. My final storage is shaping up! With only a meager 1k of data available, I first make a 64k disk, with some basic patterns to facilitate it. Unlimited spaaaaaace, I was able to move all my wall of chests and my mob farm loot into the disk, I love technology. Crafting never has been easier, but it can get better with wireless.\n\n\n\nGoodbye wall of chests.\n\n\nFirst is going to be stabilizing my autocrafting system and power supply. I’ll have to look into flux networks for ease of transport, but it looks like I need to delve more into Create… Except it seems like I’m already throttled in power, so I set up an upgraded energy cell with several dynamos always running to ensure it’s always on. This will give me some leeway until I clear out the rest. Aah, did I miss refined storage, it feels so good and convenient to use but damn does it wear on the power grid now!\n\n\n\nHello my old friend.\n\n\nDid a bit of research and figured out the best thing I should do is a giant windmill to power up my mechanical crafters, quite simple in the end. It’s pretty neat, and now I can make the crushing wheels that waited all this time. It was trickier that I thought to set them up at first, then I remembered about the gearbox… This Create mod is growing more and more on me I’ll admit, it’s fun and efficient.\n\n\n\nThe crushing wheel of progress is unstoppable.\n\n\nAnyway, next step is making the flux powder to then have access to the great flux network! My priority is the wireless charger, I hook it up to my cell and add an antenna to my storage controller. I have access to my whole storage anywhere around, hahahahaha… yeah, the range sucks. I don’t wait long to make the range upgrades, and I even push a bit to make the creative range upgrade and install it, yes! … Yeah, I didn’t expect it to drain 16K RF per tick, oh dear what? Guess I’ll make another set of normal range upgrades for now.\n\n\n\nWhat a fool I was…\n\n\n\n\nStuck in the Web\nThis settled, I will expend my data space with a higher end disk, but I need more materials. That means it’s time for processing automation! My favorite part of the mod. I begin by increasing the amount of beehives I have, and adding a lot more mixers to provide a high supply of lava to the magmatic dynamo. This should be a good buffer for the interfaces I’ll have to support… and that’s when I figured I did all that for naught, as the magmatic dynamo is the same efficiency as the stirling one except it’s a ton more annoying to supply. I regret it now.\n\n\n\nHow terribly disappointing.\n\n\nAt least, I figured out I could upgrade my dynamos for a higher output. Thanks to my bees, I have all the alloys effortlessly. And now I have a greatly increased power supply, no more issues although still far from being able to support creative range. I started making a 1024K data disk to solve my space issues, and meanwhile I used some blank eggs to get rare spawn eggs. Ok, it’s really taking forever to do the processors, so I went and shut down my mob farm as I’m getting dangerously close to data cap, and the endermen teleporting and wrecking my base every night were terribly annoying.\n\n\n\nAnother rat bites the dust.\n\n\nThat’s when tragedy strikes… I was 10 processors close to finishing the crafting, and it got deleted for reaching data cap. All the resources gone, this is maddening but I’m also stuck for data, damnit damnit damnit! I quickly make 2 extra 64K disks and then with my awesome autocrafting, I make a dozen more thermogenerators all hooked to my centrifuges. I finally offset the bee production and I negated the permanent power burden.\n\n\n\nDon’t get cold feet in this hot mess.\n\n\nI restart some processor crafting while setting up a beecon made up from uncrafted purpur blocks. I don’t have chorus flowers yet, but this’ll be handy for later. Solid power, autocrafting underway, good resources supplying without throttle from bees. I’ve reached the era of prosperity it seems, like a big chapter has been completed. Now the only thing left is to produce some crude oil and refine fuel to explore the nether.\n\n\n\nThe industry is buzzing.\n\n\n\n\nBack for the End\nIt might not seem like it, but it’s been more than a month since last time. Elden Ring swept by and only now am I back to it! It takes a while to get familiar with all my setups again… After my mind clears up enough, I aim for what I stopped at - making the nether token. Playing around with fuels yields all I need to make it, and finally I enter the Nether.\n\n\n\nGiving myself some extra time until impending doom.\n\n\nSome exploration is refreshing in a skyblock, and I find all I need to reach the next step including a blaze for my blaze burner. I can make all the elements for the end fluid, and right next is the end token!\n\n\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.\n\n\nDefeating the dragon is quite easy, unlike finding a boat for the elytra. Some time later of exploration and I got all I wanted! While I’m at it, I enter the twilight forest and bumblezone too, although I don’t stay long.\n\n\n\nDo I need an engineering degree to play mods now? Actually, it’s not that different from before huh…\n\n\nThe dimensions tab cleared, I look into Mekanism and Cyclic machines for new resources. I waste some time trying to figure out how to automatize the machine frame but give up since I don’t have pipes that can handle it(or so I think) - manual work it is.\n\n\n\nThe beeginning.\n\n\n\n\nTaking Flight\nThe new material tier allows me to do some items, including the amazing angel ring. Unlimited creative flight, what an upgrade! Since I’ll start needing a lot of materials, I decide to first set up elite centrifuges as well as apiaries. It’s already infinitely more efficient, and I’m working towards making the maximum tier but damn is it costly…\n\n\n\nThe dread of endgame…\n\n\nWhile waiting for the huge amount of resources needed to be ready(mainly nether stars), I set up a few more autocrafting for tricky materials I know I will need to make a lot of. If only I knew, I would have prepared a lot more.\n\n\n\nComb industry crashing the stocks market.\n\n\nMy apiaries go full throttle now, and the resources approach dangerously from maximum data capacity. I planned it in advance though, and had already begun the huge crafting required for the highest disk tier - slowly but surely getting closer to being able to make it just in time before reaching full cap.\n\n\n\nClearing some loose ends at the same time.\n\n\nWhile the big recipes work in the background, I progress in the end game preparation with extended crafting setups. Mekanism goes pretty well and fast, then I hit a hurdle - I need to setup 10 machines in a complex node to autocraft iron crystals so that I can make an end game ingot.\n\n\n\nPure pain.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Preparations\nIt ends up being easier to assemble, although I hate how finnicky Mekanism machines are and don’t like changing their sides for I/O. Since everything is working now, I can make my first ingot! Meanwhile, the giant crafting segments for the biggest data disk are almost complete, long overdue when I start reaching the 80% of max cap.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I should’ve done that way sooner.\n\n\nMy data space problem being fully solved, I start looking into optimizing the most demanded materials - including the too hard to get slime balls, which end up making me dabble into spawner tinkering.\n\n\n\nThis is getting costlier and costlier.\n\n\nMy autocrafting becoming more stable and efficient, I finally have enough resources to make the next tier of production - ender crafting! Damn is it costly, but this is the penultimate stretch. Speaking of stretch, this will really be a long stretch, the grind for the materials will get even higher as numbers shoot up to 6 digits. Who thought time gating things at the very end was good design…\n\n\n\nTrying out new designs.\n\n\nAt least, it makes me optimize a lot more, I even get to use another windmill with a rotation controller to hyper speed, it’s pretty funny. The ender crafting finished up some last tier machines, I tried installing it but I crashed, rip.\n\n\n\nI need to start getting into pre-crafting.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Horizon\nThe stress on my system is getting bigger as I keep increasing the amount of materials processed, but it holds well overall. Meanwhile, I setup a working core and made the final machine, the quantum compressor!\n\n\n\nLet the grind begin…\n\n\nThe power burden on the grid is much heavier since the compressor is permanently working on the many singularities needed, so I took the opportunity to optimize even more my different systems. I make a second compressor then focus on pushing to the maximum burden possible on the production, because I’ll need it…\n\n\n\nRaid party.\n\n\nIt took me forever to find a frozen biome for baby stray spawning, but that’s a big chapter complete too, two to go! I immediately start tackling the remainder of the easiest to do while the main resource grind is going underway.\n\n\n\nBiome gen is nonsense.\n\n\nLuckily, it’s really easy and short, I have all the materials and the power consumption is a trickle with my super dynamo generator. Here we go! The last chapter to stand, the hardest one of all is waiting…\n\n\n\nAn even better design!\n\n\n\n\nSwirling Production\nYou might think this is where I can just sit back and relax while it’s grinding away, but that’s actually the highest maintenance part of the adventure. So many parallel productions at once, and a lot more that need to be preplanned, my poor brain is in overclock mode.\n\n\n\nBarely enough to spend some time.\n\n\nIt was time I finished my half done rune autocrafting I was too lazy to do before. Beating down the guardian of gaia while singularities keep being made is a nice change of pace. I already did the stone one, and once the flint is completed too, the major resource burden will be lighter.\n\n\n\nThe great machine expansion.\n\n\nIt was going well, but too slow, so I went and made another crafting core - now one can permanently make blank singularities while the other consumes them.\n\n\n\nMultitasking.\n\n\nI’ve hit the “easy” cap of the limits of my existing resources, pushing me to work more to produce the various resources needed, including some forgotten ones like bronze or treated wood.\n\n\n\nTimegating, my least favorite.\n\n\n\n\nA Singular Goal in Mind\nI’m closing in on the last bits, with only a dozen or so singularities left, and all the needed resources being worked on. The major one I will need is stars, for fun and to reduce the waiting time on my bees, I decide to make a wither farm using the spawner and shield from rftools.\n\n\n\nIn the end, I could do it.\n\n\nThe hard work paid off and after a long while, I have the first out of the four final items - unlimited poweeeeeeeeer! This allows me to expand very easily even more since I don’t have to think about power anymore. I also switch to unlimited range for accessing the storage.\n\n\n\nCrucibles really suck.\n\n\nWith that out the way, there’s only a few specific resources I need anymore, so I can target what I have to optimize even more. I make the obsidian grinder cycle permanently(I should’ve done that way sooner, to be fair.) then stock up all my apiaries with glowstone bees. It’s power grinding time!\n\n\n\nBlood and tears.\n\n\nOne book and many hours later, this is it, the final item is crafted, the pack is completed! The idle time made me appreciate the soundproof blocks for the wither farm…\n\n\n\nThe long journey has reached its end.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was an entertaining introduction to the 1.16 mods, which I never got to play with before.\nThe progression through liquids was interesting, although the path I took made mostly bees worth for general production. I wish the Amadron was a bit more granular in the trade progression, since everything was available from the start. Currency tiers could be a fun idea.\nThe end part was too grindy, especially the enhanced ender, I wouldn’t have minded if it was gone from the singularities. Not being able to automatize the ender crafting was a drag.\nI still had a good time though, and I’ll be seeing you in another world!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Modpack Author: fungidelight\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.12.2 - Pack = 2.2.0\n\nIt’s the beginning of a new adventure, and this time we’re going to delve into the A Job for the Mage modpack. This pack is about fulfilling tasks for our magic school, following an interesting storyline.\nNow then, there are many worlds to discover as we become a master of our craft! Let’s hop into the portal and leave school to settle on our own.\n\nThis was an old post that was lost when the previous blog was shut down. By miracle it was salvaged through archives, but all the images were lost. All the quotes were supposed to be under a corresponding screenshot of the game. Enjoy this piece of history!\n\n\nIs fighting eldritch monsters part of our classes?\n\n\nStarting Off\nComing out of the portal, it seemed like I was lost in wilderness with trees and flowers spreading out of sight.\n\nI could swear that goat is staring at me…\n\nWith a better environment in mind for settling a home, I set off in the wilds foraging some resources. After a while, I found a village just at the junction of a river and the sea, perfect! Slightly in the distance, there was a ruined house on a small island and as night came down, I started rebuilding.\n\nWhat’s that in the distance? Maybe I should check it out.\n\nLured in by a strange portal in front of my soon-to-be home, I made the mistake of walking into it. What awaited me inside was a land of darkness full of horrors. I had to run for my life, barely having time to scrounge a few resources.\n\nAfter a full day, the portal to salvation appeared.\n\nI was finally out of the nightmare, and ran to my home, safe. In the coming days, while rebuilding I also gathered some resources going mining to trade with the villagers. With emeralds, I could trade for some basic chickens and monsters seeds, quite useful to start producing materials.\n\nReceiving my orders from the school teachers, business is starting!\n\nI was told to open my own mining dimension to gather a lot efficiently. And efficient it was, I got so much I could buy rare chickens and have leftover emeralds. I even was able to make myself a magic broom to fly in the air!\n\nThings were picking up fast.\n\nI started making a wheat farm to make some coops and begin the chicken business. I also got eaten by a shark at some point, foolish as I was. Though it was a minor setback and things were flourishing.\n\nHome sweet home.\n\n\n\nDimensions and Energy Conversion\nThen I obtained my transmutation table, and things became serious. It was time to produce EMC and get preparations ready for what was to come. But again, I made a grave mistake; I entered the Nether through a cake with no means of going back.\n\nAfter a week of flying around, I finally gathered enough obsidian to leave. Never again…\n\nOut of hell, to a freezing hell, I was so far away from my cozy home… but thankfully I found a village soon after and could warp back. I could continue on my chicken endeavors, as I had only the basic ones and forgot about the colored ones. I built a trap and put some bait, not too soon after I got a normal egg and could start breeding intensively.\n\nWhile the chickens breed, the mage studies hard.\n\nApparently my teachers were getting concerned by a sort of menace, so they sent me to check on various minor dimensions, but the only thing they did yield was more ash to make a phoenix egg. Next was defeating the wither, he’s a bad guy so surely must’ve been involved? Not a chance, but his remains allowed me to make a stronger armor.\n\nMeanwhile the chickens got an EMC upgrade.\n\nAfter that I was sent to a candy dimension to gather samples, though I have a sneaking suspicion this was not related to the threat at hand. While they were busy, I created this giant crafting table I was researching earlier and fended off a dungeon for EMC value.\n\nDue to the high cost of my research, I started making a more intensive EMC production.\n\nI had to figure out a way to make it even faster, so I resorted to surnatural means and built pedestals to put time clocks on and speed the processes. It ended up more efficient than I thought, and finally obtained the long awaited Terrasteel chickens. It was time to go to the next step.\n\nA world of endless possibilities now in my grasp.\n\n\n\nBeyond Mortal Means\nMy newfound knowledge made me access undiscovered heights and I made my EMC production go through the roof using bonsai flowers. It was time to delve into flower matters as I was told a creature named the Guardian of Gaia could be the threat.\n\nThough in the end it proved itself no worthy foe.\n\nI was then directed to the End, the dragon living there potentially being the source. But it was a fluke once again, even though it helped me reaching the end of my research as I obtained the final star and could now make and duplicate anything.\n\nAlready time for retirement? Sipping in the sunset…\n\nI grew bored of my vacation and thankfully got called back; they had new leads. I entered the Twilight Forest and wiped out everything hoping to find the source but with no results. I repeated that in many more dimensions, slaying giant insects, sun avatars, undead pharaohs and even found myself exploring the land of dreams and nightmares.\n\nThe time of revenge had come.\n\nAs I kept finding nothing, I had to go further and further into dangerous places. I went in the Betweenlands to fight an abomination then a strange floating sphere. At that point, I got recalled as it was time for pretty dangerous research on that last lead. I was to delve into dark arts.\n\nPower comes at a price…\n\nI went through the many Abyssal dimensions and managed to defeat an avatar of my dark arts teacher. But it was still not the threat! What could be the cause of this warp? My (other) teachers had to reunite and discuss the next step over a copious meal… that I had to furnish. Not that I was inconvenienced since I could create all matter from nothing, almost…\n\nA powerful mage able to bring down behemoths, reduced to jumping on grapes.\n\n\n\nThe Final Threats\nAfter this moment of intense talking, they had one last lead; I was the one who had caused this warp during my classes, where I accidently gave some ender feed to a chicken. Creating an abomination that I had to put down, so I went into my mining dimension for safety and summoned it. Despite the sword of the cosmos being inefficient, I had no shortage of means and made quick work of it.\n\nFixing the mistakes of my past.\n\nBut then, the true culprit appeared; it was my astrology teacher who had purposely swapped the food to make me fail my classes! Meanwhile my dark arts teacher had schemed to obtain the powers of the ender chicken. To no avail as I made as quick work of it as the previous one… the day was finally saved after the teacher fled into another dimension as a frog since it couldn’t get squashed.\n\nLooking scarier, but nothing can pass through my barrier!\n\n\n\nWell-Deserved Promotion\nWhile in the end, it did not prove to be too hard of a task, it was still a fun little adventure. Once again time magic proves to be the strongest weapon for a mage! I will now delve deeper into more complex studies…\nAnd with this, I write my last words in this journal with hopes that whoever reads it can gain some insight about it! It is time for me to close this chapter of my story and open a new one - orian34\n\nWith all my contributions, I was asked to teach the dark arts in the now vacant seat. Time to go back."

I don’t have a day for myself, they need me to solve their problems, and I can’t risk losing my place, but this is excruciating!” said Lion.\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: “Why do you need to take on that responsibility?”\nLion did not answer.\n\n\nPeace\nLittle Monkey was on his way when a ravenous Hyena jumped out of hiding, stopping after seeing her target.\n“What troubles you so?” asked Little Monkey.\n“My family is famished, and we have no other choice but to steal opportunities or feed on remains. The world hates us for it, and we repay it in kind; nobody else but us to help ourselves. There is no way any of us could survive alone any more, it’s an open war!” said Hyena.\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: “Is this impossible to reconcile?”\nHyena did not answer.\n\n\nBonds\nLittle Monkey was in the woods when a grunting Bear passed by, looking displeased by the sight.\n“What troubles you so?” asked Little Monkey.\n“My home is being invaded by distractions, I can’t have a moment of peace and quiet. Others are a source of problems, I got wounded because of those. This will slow me down on all the preparations before winter, I wish no one would bother me!” said Bear.\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: “Could you not ask to help for it?”\nBear did not answer.\n\n\nEgo\nLittle Monkey stopped when a hurried Ant crossed the path, almost colliding.\n“What troubles you so?” asked Little Monkey.\n“Some members of the colony didn’t uphold their roles and that resulted in a potential menace. We’ve been sent to fill the hole and dispose of the misfunctioning elements. If we don’t hurry this might create an irregularity and put the Queen at risk!” said Ant.\nLittle Monkey thought for a moment, then answered: “What about you?”\nAnt did not answer.\n\n\nBalance\nLittle Monkey watched as a mocking Crow landed next to him, laughing alone from an untold joke.\n“What troubles you so?” asked Little Monkey.\n“You wouldn’t understand, like all the others that ostracized me. They don’t like the way I do things so they excluded me, unable to truly accept me for who I am.

I could trip and fall, a bad landing and I’m stuck on the back, or worse, cracked open!

    "title": "Review of Ragecraft 4 - Underworld",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: heliceo & Suso\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.20.1 - Map = 1.0\n\n\nPresentation\nRagecraft 4 - Underworld is a full length CTM map. Ragecraft 3 has been one of the most influential maps for the beginning of the modern CTM maps, so it goes without saying that this was a very anticipated release… But not for me, I wasn’t following progress or checking teasers, I knew it would come out at some point but I wasn’t expecting or waiting on anything - it comes out when it comes out and I’ll see how it holds up then. However if you haven’t played this map yet, I ask you to do so first before reading more. BEGONE!\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Descent - White\n\n\n\nThe resting place of giant creatures.\n\n\nThe first area always has a difficult weight to bear, here it had a great mix of old school survival with modern mechanics. The water has great level design interactions, and the level design is just top tier to slowly introduce the player to more complex finds. The low amount of coal made me feel like a crack addict scraping the bits I could find, and I ran out at the monument. It’s not an area where I have a lot to say, but I have to highlight the beehive encounters as great one-ofs that maybe should be done more often in maps.\n\n\nThe Nexus - Monument\n\n\n\nSo familiar yet different…\n\n\nIt’s a really pretty place, although things are a bit too spread out sadly. I wasn’t sure where to have the base of operation due to the teleporter room, monument, and forge being a walk away each, even with speed 2 it felt a lot of time spent on moving around. Glad to see so many dogs in the garden! The portable portal is a fantastic idea and a smart way of solving the teleporters not always covering enough space.\nFinally, the biggest talk of the map, the cornerstone of the adventure, the rune forge is a really intricate upgrade system allowing a lot of gear freedom. Exactly the kind of custom upgrading I wished to see. Although it leaves the smithing table upgrade in the dust with the way it works, meaning you need to be careful to upgrade before building the items and some custom ones simply can’t. Overall it is fantastic and a real pleasure being able to apply abilities instead of being constrained to single items that don’t evolve.\n\n\nThe Rock - Orange\n\n\n\nVine boom.\n\n\nSo much immersion! The villagers have sleeping rooms, only in this map can I roleplay Steve the Barbarian destroying blazes with axe throws. This is where it really becomes apparent that areas really don’t joke around and you’ll need to explore to find the next path and objective. The havoc axe is insaaaane! The enemies also follow that path with thematic elite abilities, it’s clear combat will stay complex as things progress.\n\n\nIllager’s Keep - Magenta\n\n\n\nWhat a terrible night to have a curse.\n\n\nThe combat is becoming more intense, and it really pushed me to use my aoe weapons and abilities, the infiniflasks are really well made to push regular use while staying balanced. The area palette felt a bit dark but the level design is made in a way you don’t have to care about dark corners. New offhand combined with axe throw transformed me into the doom slayer, it’s become clear that the map will thrive in giving you pieces to assemble with deadly synergies. The first riddle was really fun and clever.\nThe potion traps felt a bit random and kinda unfair (after all, it uses function detection, nothing in the game directly) however the tell blocks were changed since to become more apparent. I believe hiding the strength buff(and other timed active buffs) from the ruby offhand was a mistake despite being intentional, because then the icon doesn’t show up in combat and it forces guesswork to know if it’s active or not. I tend to prefer hiding permanent effects and intentionally keeping the occasional bursts as visible to give a visual tell.\nMost elites and the boss having a sort of projectile shield or magic immunity felt like a necessary choice to ensure things wouldn’t go too out of hand with so many good tools given. Speaking of the boss, it was just the right amount of incredible and a good test of my arsenal. I was allowed to go ham with my axe and the spells forced some adaptation, the antipoison flask became an important element to remove hazard and my only regret was the lack of such weakness type mechanics in the map - even if some got close to it. I liked the separation in rooms for each phase of the battle and the incremental variation it kept adding to the fight, having to deal with the statues and pits by needing survival block placing was something too rarely seen in boss fights, which is exactly the reason of a small nitpick: the second room, introducing pits in the battle, has small walkways to reach the boss but in truth you really want to fill the holes first and if it forced you more to do so it could’ve taught me faster instead of needing several deaths by falling.\n\n\nBoombog Bastion - Light Blue\n\n\n\nAnother civilization pacified.\n\n\nIt certainly begins with a DoT jungle area full of spiders and creepers, thankfully the flasks make it quite fun by acting as a solution to some of the dangers. It is quite full of valuable things to find and truly reward going on the sidepaths - I loved solving the maze and the optional boss was neat even if a bit more standard. Made a truly deadly cleaver for 39 damage on crits, you can call me the Butcher now. The many custom options give us a lot of fun pieces to brew with and it keeps expanding.\nThe castle part was more standard, taking a side path led me closer to the objective than I expected so it felt short if I didn’t count the jungle. The flying creepers were very deadly since the moment you hear them it’s already too late, NANI!? The queens were a good problem solved by using aoe.\n\n\nPrismarine Empire - Yellow\n\n\n\nBreathtaking.\n\n\nUnderwater areas are only so bad as the ranged options given, and in this map we’re spoiled. Using spells, axe throws and the noxious trail meant I had a fair chance fighting the enemies in molasses. I even got to use the turtle helmet I found the previous area. Modern minecraft tech really allowed water gameplay to feel how it should’ve been all along, cool and good. The casters with unstoppable seeking missiles felt overkill combined with skeletons and trident drowneds.\n\n\nCrystal Quarry - Lime\n\n\n\nDiggy diggy hole.\n\n\nThis area felt more like a rest area, with less intense elites and simple terrain, acting as an intersection it makes sense. On the other hand it was jam-packed with incredible runes and my gear got a lot of upgrades. The final segment was cool (badum tss) and thankfully not too long, it could have gone very wrong with a different design. Perfect to make zoom zoom players malding. I took the time to find the teleporters to each further area before clearing it.\n\n\nObsidian Throne - Pink\n\n\n\nThis isn’t Farum Azula is it?\n\n\nA fairly high difficulty spike, along with the ruined terrain this area is nervous and deadly. I finally found an amazing axe(Crescent Moon) that made me change from the axe throw ability to a shadow grab, and it also pushed me to completely redo my entire armor setup and offhand, big build turnaround for Frozen Grasp!\nFull on debuff and sadism, finally getting leggings suffix runes too to benefit from the many buffs. The looks are also incredible with fun gameplay going from top to bottom. My favorite area by far, with every mob design fitting well even if the level design is more flat. The final segment was the perfect place to try out my new build and it was a slaughter, ghasts and blazes don’t stand a chance.\n\n\nWatcher’s Realm - Gray\n\n\n\nThe ring has been broken.\n\n\nA really cool theme, but sadly I think the mechanic puts too much pressure on the player and it made it not pleasant by pushing me to make mistakes. Combined with a fairly creeper heavy area, many opportunities to get one shot arose. Thankfully it’s short, I’m glad to be done with it… The second part was easier than the first due to much larger land to navigate, which felt like the area might have flowed better if it was the opposite progression that had happened - from large to narrow.\n\n\nCannibal Slaughterhouse - Light Gray\n\n\n\nIt’s a candy factory, I swear.\n\n\nIt begins with a tough boss fight where my newly made build was completely negated, oof. The first phase had me struggling most, then the second killed me because I wasn’t aware I would need the antipoison flask. After that, I was able to defeat the boss using my strong bow and some positioning to avoid being encircled and patiently waiting for opportunities to strike. Pretty fun overall even if the arena was a bit bland.\nThen the new area was really cool, bloody water is always a hit for me and the villager sidequest was fun to mix in the area goals. The super axe elite using our own abilities was a cool twist and they’re great here, butcher against butcher. The riddle felt alright, but too mechanical and easy to randomly solve so not as interesting. Xin’s challenge on the other hand was pretty fun and easy enough that even a parkour hater like me didn’t struggle much.\nThe introduction of a new type of runes/resource was a bit more mixed, I felt like a good amount of the new lower level ones were just filler already weaker than previous ones. My inventory at this point is suffering, so many resources, unique items, runes, tools, it’s still manageable thanks to the shulker box and teleport tools, but that makes the long path from the tp room that much longer. I tried a thunder slam build but it felt so lackluster I went back to Frozen Grasp.\n\n\nEmpyrian Gardens - Cyan\n\n\n\nGrumble grumble why is it not named Empyrean.\n\n\nA simpler area, with the biggest particularity being the many fast nat zombees creating a hounding sense while progressing, working especially well in the hanging vines maze. The second segment was more interesting, the visibility quite impaired changed the gameplay by needing to be more careful. It made me wish for spurs though, breaking the grass added a lot of tedium this could have solved. The beekeeper elite was incredibly effective and thematic.\n\n\nDreadfire Stronghold - Purple\n\n\n\nA hot topic!\n\n\nA cleaner area, with straight paths and rooms, and the main danger coming from the enemy hazards and verticality - it was a fun and tense time teetering on the edge. Somehow there was a lack of blaze encounters spam where it would have made the most sense. It took me a while to go clear the area because I got lost in the next 3 areas trying to clear loose paths. The diamond cleaver is insanely good and feels like the best axe variant by far, the halberds being way too slow at this point when combat always requires fast reaction to the many mobs attacking.\nI kept shadow grasping the blademaster elites and they kept trolling me by jumping away, grr. I didn’t feel a lot of threat from fire overall, when are we banning water buckets completely from maps? The pickaxe was a blast, and I was glad the tnt room gave the most important item first, but the mobs felt too rng to really feel doable. On the other hand, why wasn’t all the TNT primed? You’re being too nice.\n\n\nSimulacrum - Blue\n\n\n\nWow! The land of make-believe!\n\n\nIt’s an interesting area with powerful enemies to deal with, similarly to Pink each mob here feels like a unique threat but here it’s really cursed, the hardest part of the area is the messy terrain making traversal and charting difficult. Due to that, I really had to make use of shadow grasp and some ranged backup, pure melee is a terrible choice here even if you need an answer to the zombie hounding which is more dangerous than in area 10. The riddle took a bit to understand, but once it all clicked it was a really fun solving.\nI liked the theme and mob designs and the second part was great, it gave me flashbacks from the best Divinity’s End area. The banshees didn’t cause me that much trouble thanks to my build being strong enough to kill them before the ability triggering… most of the time. Getting blindness after each teleportation was maybe a bit much when the player is already disoriented and now you struggle seeing the threats right around you.\n\n\nHouse of Horror - Brown\n\n\n\nGrandma, stop looking through the window!\n\n\nLoving the spooky designs and the gameplay is clean and dangerous, what I needed after the messy terrain, the vampire elite is once again a great thematic encounter that pushes you to use aoe. Just like for Gray, I wished the darkness halls were lifted to explore more properly once the area is completed, not that I didn’t manage to clear it in the dark. I found a new axe ability that made me decide to completely switch my build once again. Going full Frenzied Flame with the void rage ability to regain all the mana I spend attacking and getting haste 2 and absorption orbs on kills along fire attacks and trail. RIP AND TEAR!\nThe final riddle was incredible and the creeper paranoia maze was everything you could want from ragecraft. When I entered the theatre stage I expected a warden to come out… I wonder why.\n\n\nFrigid Palace - Green\n\n\n\nNo aurora borealis? No time of the day? Why can’t I see it?\n\n\nA pretty unique area, where your build directly affects how you will handle the mechanics. Knowing it was coming certainly helped me choose my new build and the fire trail ensured I could move around safely in this treacherous land of ice. The elites are getting quite bulky and the mobs don’t joke around, thankfully I’m just as strong and the tools aren’t few.\nThis is the area that played around the most with environmental mechanics directly tied with mob design. There was a surprisingly low amount of powdered snow use. So… many… fire… particles… Other than that I don’t have much to say about this area, it was a stronger counterpart of Purple, and an overall fun area.\n\n\nVoidstorm Citadel - Red\n\n\n\nThe fog made it painful to get a good picture.\n\n\nThe Gatekeeper was really fun and intense, the right amount of dangerous and also required some survival building to defeat it - I was glad my build was reworked to have fire res and I used a few of the many consumables stored. I wonder what happens if you run out of redstone during the fight if you didn’t plan for it to need so much? Maybe it would be nice to make the redstone guards drop 3 extra dusts along the block?\nThe first half of this area doesn’t joke around, with a very deadly elite to boot. Made me change my build, removing the fire side to go for full Exalted Rage, sadly that means I didn’t get to benefit more from the torch convenience. I feel like the mushrooms should have given you an encyclopedia tell after the first, I instantly died because I didn’t understand it and ran into 3 at once. Navigating the terrain was a bit exhausting in the fog and I was glad that the second part of the area was smooth and clean pathways. Somehow it felt easier than the first half despite the more intense fighting, maybe it was because I fully unlocked the potential of my build, becoming a machine of death. The crystal guardians and wardens were a fun twist on the key mechanic for an overall solid area.\n\n\nRuptured Realm - Black\n\n\n\nFeel the rage, embrace the void. RIP AND TEAR!\n\n\nThe final area in big CTM maps tends to be a retrospective in some way, looking back to the journey before the last stop. Somehow the mobs have never been this deadly, but I feel like I transcended my mortal condition and shred through it all with ease aside the unique abilities that I can’t brush off. The elytra use felt a bit performative and not that useful, would’ve been more fun to have obstacle weaving to do in each transition. The revisited areas are really cool with the old improved items and mobs, and the permanent void hunt replaces the lack of nat spawns to create pressure in the familiar spaces.\nAnd to top it all off, the big finale against the crystal is really good. The soft keys just before are an interesting way to allow a harder fight if you wish to. At that point I had a really powerful build so I didn’t struggle too much blind, but it still felt like a worthy battle. Although one criticism I could have (and slightly global to the full area as well) is that the sculk mechanic is underexploited, at that point the player is already super buffed and that makes the system feel like a sidenote which doesn’t hold a lot of relevancy, unlike green where you had to clear it out to kill some mobs. Keeping in that line for the boss battle, aside my personal hate for jump boost and where it messed with fighting because I didn’t pay attention to not jump from it, what I felt was lacking was that unlike all the other major boss fights which had a mechanic or phase that required you using survival mechanics in some way (Crypt needed to block out gaps, Metamorph needed to build walls to break gaze, Gatekeeper needed to connect redstone circuitry) this fight didn’t introduce a similar one and settled with only spawners to break. Other than that, the elite hunting, variating powers, periodic buffs and attacks, some very light platforming, all combined into an intense and rewarding final battle.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe great wall of relics, can you name them all?\n\n\nNow where does this leave us? The map had a less condensed gameplay style, more like a journey with nat spawns bridging the lower amounts of spawners on the path - those nat spawns being really well balanced and interesting. Usually this would mean the gameplay would suffer from entropy syndrome but here the level design also masterfully integrated the gameplay and paths - with the monument being the only exception, where the looks were prioritized. This journey style also meant less secrets to hunt for, with most corners not being worth checking, a larger scale of exploration. A small sidenote was that elite spawners could’ve been made into preloaded normal mob spawners, instead of being a dead one after the initial spawn.\nIt pains me to say this when so much care was put into it, the death system… it didn’t feel like it brought something (aside the cool factor), but I’m aware this is a more global design conflict I have with grave systems used in modern maps. To explain what I mean, modern graves solve the fact you could drop and lose your items on death, preserving them instead, but despite that they still force you to do the tedium of dangerous death runs and recuperating your gear. And that’s where the saddest part comes in: this map solves it, in fact the resource needed to spend on that is so abundant the cost is barely a sidenote to instantly give your items back. What’s the problem then, you’d say… the problem, it’s that why do we even lose our gear to begin with, if it’s so cheap and easy to get it back? I personally would have preferred having total keepinventory, and instead it taking away a part of xp and maybe some resources, in the end making it cost more than currently, but without having to go through an entire process for the same result. And shutting down completely the need of death runs, because while the option is given to skip the process, it feels faster to just run directly there to continue progress, taking a convenience shortcut that can lead to more deaths because the choice was made to make extra steps. The player isn’t blameless in that problem, yet it’s still a design I felt I had to criticize because it was very relevant during my run. If your gear is protected, why make it tedious to get it back? Sorry for this rant, consider it more of a general critique and not just about this map.\nThe riddles were quite fun and pretty tough! It’s the kind of bonus content I really crave in maps, we don’t need only combat and the emerald rewards were incredible. I would have loved that vegetation(especially nether plants) and varied blocks had more edited loot tables to completely remove or transform into less clutter in the inventory. In direct consequence of that, the objectives look too plain in the inventory and I almost threw them away more than once. It’s a bit of a niche thing, but I tend to mention when maps add a lot of miscellaneous containers that could benefit the player from not spending the UI time searching, hence locking irrelevant ones. In some areas, the keys felt a bit too much like a mcguffin and sometimes led to an anticlimactic resolution, in Pink the keys are just existing but it ends in an epic throne room gauntlet, while in Red it’s expertly thematic but ends in “you did it”, Brown suffers from the same aspect.\nI loved the potions that don’t hurt us and the unique spell wands, providing many tools. Standard minecraft makes it hard to want to use more than big stick bonk but here not only was it necessary it was actually fun and actively engaging. The many rune abilities really rewarded homebrewing builds and the pieces are really good at allowing synergies, this is something I’ve always wanted to see more of and had started to lean more into so it’s very pleasing to see it done so well here. There was a strange gap in progression, due to having too many helmet suffix runes and not enough leggings options until very late, it would have felt better if it was more even instead of looking at 20 helmets options knowing only 3 or 4 will really be used in the run.\nAnd for the biggest meal, the forge system is amazing, the runes add a fun aspect to loot where it tends to always have potential worth and it allows you to customize gear a lot. Hooooowever (here comes the nitpicker), it’s unfortunate that upgraded items break the smithing upgrade system, and that’s an issue I also had to deal with in my own system so I know there’s no easy solution to keep pretty attributes and upgrading. I also would have loved a way to overwrite rune slots on an item, but that just might not be compatible with the system. And at last but not least, repairing and durability felt like a superfluous vanilla mechanic in this map. Resources are so abundant that most of the time repairing is costing more (if you die you lose all xp) than just remaking items, and it’s never really an issue. It doesn’t provide tension or scarcity, durability becomes only an annoying inconvenience when so much effort is put into making the custom items.\nThe fact the only criticism I really have is nitpicking and personal preferences shows how much care has been worked into this map, testing period and post-release included. It’s hard to describe from the present the impact it will have in future times, but after discussing a lot about how the map came into fruition and experiencing the final result it is clear it deserves to be called a turning point in CTM history, just as its predecessor was. I had an incredible time, and so will many others."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: Cake\nOrigin: Map Link\n\n\nPresentation\nLost Embers is a full length CTM map. It is open world with custom items and textures.\nIt was advertised as very hard. That point will be relevant later.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Wires\n\n\n\nDire wire warning.\n\n\nThis is a really unusual and fun way to start a map, made me feel like I was breaking into a forbidden place as I thought I skipped the “start map” button. The area does something I haven’t seen a lot of, and that’s having gameplay without gear. You’re not intended to beat it using a pickaxe or weapons really, instead you have to navigate the wire maze and make use of the few bits you can break off of the circuits.\n\n\nThe Cliffs\n\n\n\nAlmost looks peaceful.\n\n\nThe challenge in this shredded area is to settle a small base and get materials to make your gear. It’s a somewhat hostile place but with more than enough rewards to thrive. There are so many hidden rooms and corners, it’s very easy to miss parts even after clearing it. The objective room build up mobs very easily, which is a good introduction to the global style of the map. Also introduces you to the most important tool, exploding arrows.\n\n\nThe Monument\n\n\n\nReclaiming home is a hard task.\n\n\nThe monument being a full-on area was great. Usually it’s just a side place, but here it didn’t make me feel like I was robbed of an objective or area slot. Due to being a dungeon too, it’s very convoluted and not that convenient to use as a base aside the open rooms next to the monument itself. It’s after settling in that things really open, with now 4 different potential areas directly connected to go to. The giant door promising to open after getting the other 15 wools.\n\n\nThe Nest\n\n\n\nSkittering frights and jittering sights.\n\n\nThis is a textbook spider spam area, on paper it would be big nope, but it’s pretty fun due to the segmented cheese layout. The final chamber made me use the absorption potions and I like that it pushed me to be more resourceful. The design itself is very standard and can be boiled down to “caves with cobwebs”.\n\n\nThe Bridge\n\n\n\nFinal destination.\n\n\nGood area that keeps you on the edge, with intentional buildup choke points that push you to expend your explosive arrows. It makes good use of the verticality to allow diverse approaches and threats.\n\n\nThe Pit\n\n\n\nPrime tourist spot.\n\n\nDeadlier and meaner, the pure verticality means the mob buildup is almost permanent, making you really try different approaches as too slow or too fast can lead to problematic dead ends. The map is still very generous and hands out lots of goodies in case you fall a bit too deep. This is also where you learn that fire does indeed spread.\n\n\nThe Temple\n\n\n\nPurpur and void, name a more iconic combo.\n\n\nA more standard dungeon, but still exploiting verticality with many openings so you’re rarely safe as you go down. The rifle crossbow was amazing to clear out the mob swarms!\n\n\nThe Mines\n\n\n\nTime for a peaceful mining session… Almost.\n\n\nVery unconventional with the objective hanging almost at the start, it’s a lot of winding paths with plenty of resources. The hazard danger is quite high while the mobs are fairly low in numbers for once. It was a nice breather area after the more intense ones, the shortcut was appreciated too. I fell for the snow trap like a dummy despite knowing it was there and not using leather boots for it…\n\n\nThe Fortress\n\n\n\nAlmost looks like a vanilla one.\n\n\nI don’t know if it’s because I adapted, or that the area is easier than expected, but it was a pleasant dungeon to beat. The crystals help clearing out some danger in advance, and your explosive arrows will be valuable for the many free targets. The wool chamber is basically free real estate. Exploring the outskirts also lead to really nice things, like a full mending gold armor set, or a whole new bonus objective goal, and even a hint house.\n\n\nThe Cavern\n\n\n\nLost Mario level.\n\n\nQuite short, the fire hazard is magnified with the spawners in hard to reach places. Hot action guaranteed! It was very chaotic at times, but that’s where explosive arrows shine the most. The hidden sewer section giving away the recipe for flameblood needles is an amazing reward.\n\n\nThe Sewer\n\n\n\nNo crocodile here.\n\n\nI went into it from behind and it was quite hard. Very little safe footing and many ranged threats, going up from under had some benefits but I quickly backed down after the midway point when witches started to rain down. Shoot your arrows everywhere.\n\n\nThe Oven\n\n\n\nDon’t put your head inside.\n\n\nThis area is what I wish vanilla nether would be; very hostile and requiring extreme care. With the looming threat of complete wipe into lava as well as high concentrations of deadly mobs, I chose to tackle the area in a very systematic manner, spending a high amount of my valuable resources to make it a sure victory. Being the penultimate challenge and highest difficulty, it only made sense to expend my stocked supplies, and the incredible rewards made it all the more worth it. The lava waders are something that make so much sense I’m surprised it never really got done before, feels incredible to use.\n\n\nThe Wall\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge.\n\n\nQuite out of order, the area still proved challenging with the extreme catwalk layout. It was a bit confusing to navigate, but the area is so small and open it wasn’t a real issue.\n\n\nThe City\n\n\n\nNeon city without the neons.\n\n\nLast time this area layout made me quit a map, this time I crushed it since I had all the tools. A very chaotic area where you need to move fast and act decisively or you die. Definitely unfair if you try to do it early, but the point is to beat it smart. This is also an extremely rewarding loot place(arguably even too much), combined with 2 objectives. Fire tick being on made a really epic moment where I had to conquer an apartment on fire with creepers raining down on me. Managed to waste the netherite ingot on the wrong chestplate, leading me to display it on the wall of shame…\n\n\nThe Finale\n\n\n\nArguably a troll area.\n\n\nCombine all the previous chaos and amp it up with many tnt stashes around creeper and blaze spawners. Don’t expect to beat the area without at least one or two mass explosion, it’s the hardest the map went, yet it’s also quite easy because you have the strongest gear and have no more future challenges to save up resources on. It’s also a very joke area at times, where it feels like Cake stopped holding back for the finale. It was a lot of fun but damn was I broken, near immortal. Somehow ended up creating an even more comical situation when I dug the center of the boss arena and the boss fell into the void as it spawned.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe map was lots of fun, exploration is rewarded handsomely with many many secrets, along with shattered levels that force you to use blocks to travel safely. Even with standard or almost vanilla terrain at times, the amount of secrets and tricky spawner placements make it exciting to explore, and each area is fairly short so problems don’t have time to become annoying. There were tons of loot and lots of mob spam, the design clearly prioritized chaotic fun over tight balance, and I feel like it’s showing as Cake’s style at this point.\nIn another map, I’d have complained about the low spawn delays, the spawner spam and abuse of blazes almost everywhere… but not here, because of the overabundant loot and amazing explosive arrows. It’s a hard, unrelenting map, but it provides everything for the player to break the dam; it’s up to you to win with the tools given. It introduces some unique ideas and tools that help diversifying approaches. On the other hand, I’m quite disappointed by the persistent mobs which barely were relevant despite the huge potential. Also wished a bit more recipes to find maybe?\nIf I was told previously that this year there would be an insanely fun and hard full-length map that would have enough innovative designs to give me a ton of inspiration, I would have answered: Oh, Untold Stories 9 releases this year? And yet, it is about this map, whose expectations on were that it would be a very unfun hardcore map. This shows that expectations aren’t useful, as things likely will never be as you expect, and it puts a burden on what’s to come to be conformed to those expectations.\nSo yes, don’t trust the very hard rating, it’s a very good map. But also don’t trust me, and see for yourself by playing it.\n\n\n\nHiding the wall of shame with the shell."

    "text": "Modpack Author: NillerMedDild\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.12.2\n\n\nPresentation\nEnigmatica 2 Expert is an elaborate Minecraft modpack with a push towards tech.\nImportant to specify that I finished playing it a year ago, and after some events lost the old walkthrough post along the previous blog place, so this is a retell of a recent story before it is lost to memory.\n\n\nOverview\n\nGarden of Eden\nThus starts the adventure in this world, my eyes lay on the surroundings, showing a peaceful apple orchard next to the sea.\n\n\n\nI arrived into paradise.\n\n\nThe most important goal right now is to quickly clear up space for a small camp, to prepare the base of operations. Gathering some flint from the nearby waterside, I obtained a full set of simple tools ready for use.\n\n\n\nThe first night came, but I was ready.\n\n\nI quickly got to work and set up a basic smeltery to mold some metal parts and upgrade my tools. The mine goes deeper and I find more and more ores to various uses, even some diamonds!\n\n\n\nMetal progression isn’t a major concern here.\n\n\nWhile digging, I find some vis crystals so I decide to spend more time in researching that field. Advances in technology progress fast on the side, with upgrade kits allowing me to open a portal to the nether and bringing the hell ores back.\n\n\n\nLooming in the distance, oily sands all around.\n\n\n\n\nPower, Mysticism and Astrology\nExploration yielded several more materials needed to unlock gates leading to different mods. I can get started in several directions and get access to new machines, albeit not very efficient, for better ore production.\n\n\n\nWhat a terrible night to have a curse.\n\n\nA small step for tech, a leap for magic. I setup a very simple mana production, then a great sky temple for the stars, and even a blood altar! With my few power means, I can produce some rubber and begin semi-automatizing some resources using pipes. Business is booming, I even get to make a mystical agriculture gem.\n\n\n\nDovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin!\n\n\nMy expedition yielded some precious materials, and for the first time ever I learned how to use rituals! I use them to boost my crop growth to great effect, and I’m sure this will end up a major tool later on… Another trip to the nether and my blood altar receives a lot of upgrades, efficiency primes!\n\n\n\nObtaining various means, but I’m too inexperienced to make good use of it.\n\n\nMy first terrasteel made, I decide it’s the right time to setup a mob farm since I have all the tools available and a mob slaughter factory. I use a solar panel from a loot crate and it’s good enough to sustain it at this stage.\n\n\n\nThe costly door to another world.\n\n\n\n\nThe End of Beginnings\nAll the required elements assembled, two portals could be opened, the most important one leading to the End. Having astral gateways is really handy, huh… With a slew of new materials available, I continue on my endeavors, with some risky experimentation and electrical upgrades.\n\n\n\nDon’t attempt this at home.\n\n\nBeing well advanced in magical matters, I look to the tech side for improvements. Getting better machines means the power grid is taking a hit, and I’ll admit I never was a great energy supplier. Scraping by so far, I get a major machine that will matter(haha) for the rest of the pack: the matter fabricator. The duplicating fluid producer…\n\n\n\nGates are opening one after the other.\n\n\nWith so many options, I have a lot of work of setup to start making use of all the new means of production. I get smarter and use a power cell as buffer during the day for another solar panel to keep powering the night. The replicator is installed and while the amount of fluid is a bit low, the option to duplicate specific items is appearing!\n\n\n\nHahahaha, the stars are aligned! Time is mine to control!\n\n\nMy power explodes after obtaining some RTGs(some sort of self-generator) and production goes full throttle. This is the first time I feel so liberated from power constraints, and quests are unbridled, downing them by the dozen. The industrial revolution is coming!\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, magic upgrades itself in its own corner.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Matter of Machines\nThe UU-Matter(duplicating fluid) is being produced much faster now, and a good amount of the complex casings can be replicated, allowing me to bypass recipes after the first time. I even started making my own uranium RTGs to have self-powered machines more spread out and almost all of the gates are opened!\n\n\n\nI’m starting to get the hang out rituals.\n\n\nAll this free ore definitively solves resource shortage aside some exceptions, and the biggest change is on the horizon. I finally make an ME Controller, no more slog through chests, it’s disk storage time(although I’m still very new to it)! I tried various ways to produce more power but they all ended up severely disappointing… I’ll stay with my RTGs.\n\n\n\nA trip that ends well despite the bad luck midway. No way home after the portal blows up, it’s a desperate struggle to go back.\n\n\nDespite the poor attempts, the power generated is still worthy of use, and I install garden cloches for the mystical seeds as well as a laser miner for more ores. Seeing how spread out everything begins to be, I make use of draconic power crystals to bypass the need of power conduits. Veeery handy!\n\n\n\nCoal generation to the next level.\n\n\nI crafted a radar that was originally made for ore detection, but I went a step above and tuned it to detect chests. With this, I can easily find out dragon dens from the amount of chests showing up, it’s time to be rich! This yields a tremendous amount of resources for better RTGs and most importantly, dragon eggs! This will be handy for forging dragonsteel.\n\n\n\nI have enough resources to enter a new age.\n\n\n\n\nDigital Era\nI’ve gotten more confident in my refined storage usage, and now that I can access wirelessly my crafting interface, I truly changed the paradigm. I begin by linking all my production using an enderchest network and assemble a ridiculously strong dragonsteel sword with many enchantments on it. Poor wither has become a punching bag…\n\n\n\nTime to automatize everything.\n\n\nGrowing, growing, the tree of life is growing. I’ve received some advice on how to utilize better my storage system, for the fabled autocrafting! So I began growing my crafting tree of life… I’ve been told interfaces were everything with this version, and spoiler, it was correct. First step of autocrafting, install a way to autocraft the materials needed to expand the autocrafting.\n\n\n\nThe roots are anchoring themselves, heehee.\n\n\nAfter crushing the enhanced guardian of gaia, I begin the great renovation in the basement, with a lot of self sufficient machines that run by themselves for autocrafting. All these resources will be at a click’s reach! As my tree expands, I become needy of more power once again, pushing me to look into reactors and other cheap ways.\n\n\n\nIt’s diamonds time!\n\n\nI line up RTGs above my garden cloches and set up a melon farm to produce ethylene and power a turbine generator. The production is self sufficient, and for once the effort was worth it because wowie the output is delicious. The more turbines I’ll add, the more power generated, it can keep on growing! I found the solution to my energy problems definitively this time.\n\n\n\nUnlimited powaaaaaah!\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Down Rules\nWith the efficiency of the dragon crystals, transmitting power to everything is child’s play, and I can even grow my crafting tree of life along the garden cloches. Everything has become easy to power and I don’t have to fear an outage. Since I can afford it now, I build an arc furnace next to my mob farm to melt all the useless gear pieces dropped to add some extra materials to my stash.\n\n\n\nInfinite UUworks.\n\n\nEverything is easy to power and make now, so I install a void miner to have it function on the side, because they always take forever to go up tiers. The roots of my tree keep expanding as more autocrafting takes place with new machines.\n\n\n\nGreen power returns to the earth.\n\n\nProgress goes by leaps and bounds, and there’s even machines to automate crafting from thaumcraft and astral sorcery! How wonderful, I’m living the dream currently. I also upgraded the void miner and found a secret page to explain what the corrupted version of the Horologium ritual does… this will be useful, I can sense it.\n\n\n\nOh dear… Now that’s a massive problem.\n\n\nI quickly go through the twilight forest progression to defeat the Ur-Ghast and… Did I mention I love this mod? It’s my favorite dimension mod for years now, and it’s always a pleasure to go through it, even while being overpowered. Anyway, I need a ton of void seeds, so it’s time to corrupt the plane of existence… Thankfully I have the means to make it more efficient now.\n\n\n\nBreaking both space AND time.\n\n\n\n\nTo Infinity and Beyond\nWhile finally being able to craft better platings for nuclear machines and RTGs, a massive corruption outbreak happens not too far from my mob farm, oh dear… Thankfully it doesn’t expand too much and stays fairly contained, as long as I regularly kill the abominations popping up. Meanwhile I place down an excavator to obtain bauxite, as that’s the only known way to obtain it and make ender IO casings.\n\n\n\nThe tree sprouted an offshoot… What do you mean that’s not how trees work?\n\n\nI probably forgot to mention it, but at some point I added more ethylene generators. You don’t change a winning formula! I needed the power to keep expanding with all the new machines, especially since I’ll be preparing a rocket soon. You can’t skimp out on resources for this.\n\n\n\nSeems like the wither farm works. Goodbye my friend…\n\n\nThe big machines are getting expansive, but thankfully my autocrafting system is keeping up and I’m never on the backfoot. I even added a special space floor to get in the mood and refill with oxygen. A tower later and my rocket is filled, it’s adventure time!\n\n\n\nGoodbye my sweet home.\n\n\nAlthough I totally didn’t forget to first send a base into space… and use a homing system so the rocket comes back… Ok, truth is I had to make another rocket. Anyway, the new planets have what I needed, and some extras! This allows me to begin building some extreme reactors and eye the draconic evolution things.\n\n\n\nNo wires to look at.\n\n\n\n\nGoing Big\nIt’s a bit difficult, but I understand how to have autocrafting work on the extended crafting tables. After all, this is going to be a necessity for all the late game stuff. I start looking into the needed materials to make machine chassis, needed for the last tier of ender IO machines.\n\n\n\nSymmetry is important in arcana.\n\n\nI know the pain will be unavoidable, the singularities will be unavoidable, I don’t have a choice but to set it up now instead of later… While it runs on its own, I work hard on crafting costly elements. To that goal, I even added another mob room with a powered spawner for specific drops farming.\n\n\n\nAnd this is only the beginning…\n\n\nThrough toil and trouble, the fusion crafting core is ready for use, the final crafting tiers have been reached… Almost. Using some redstone for safety heatlock, a stronger and better nuclear reactor helps power surging for the huge power demand of fusion crafting. The moment has come to progress in draconic evolution, and I heard horror stories about it…\n\n\n\nThe most terrifying foe to face, stuck in a time fissure. Fool!\n\n\nThankfully, I don’t have to rematch against it ever again in this pack, because the shard dropped is replicable, muahahaha! Upgrading my fusion crafting is child’s play now. This opens another final tier production, the neutron collector. And oh dear is this slow…\n\n\n\nBut cheating time is a second nature for me at this point.\n\n\n\n\nGoing Home\nA daunting task suddenly stops me in my tracks, I have to make a fusion core reactor and it seems incredibly obtuse and annoying. After pain, sweat, and tears, I manage to make it work without issues, but my past self was right I don’t like it. The oh-so-precious neutron fluid in my possession, the ultimate ingots ready, I’m only a few steps away from the creative tank. The necessary first step to break the endgame.\n\n\n\nThank goodness this is all autocrafted.\n\n\nThe tank here, the neutron fluid is now a joke that I can infinitely produce, hah! Any fluid in my possession can be freely duplicated effortlessly, this will be a huge help for making the singularities.\n\n\n\nAll the means are good when it’s about those…\n\n\nMore singularities, more! Hahahahaha, hahaha, hahahahahahaaaa… AAAAAAAH! To avoid becoming insane, I clear out all the remaining quests in all the stages I haven’t yet completed. This is the last sliver of sanity I can preserve. All these efforts leading to making more ultimate singularities and the remaining elements…\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean this isn’t part of the ritual?\n\n\nEverything culminates to make the ultimate ingot… which can be duplicated using the tank! This huge step done, I can fairly easy make the creative power cell for infinite RF, and making the creative gas tank is simple too. Then the final step, after major lag to autocraft the tier 6 solar generators, the creative vending upgrade, which allows duplicating items without restrictions. The pack is basically over at this point!\n\n\n\nCompleting all the remaining quests is child’s play.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is it then, I’ll be honest, I didn’t remember every twist and turn but hopefully this retelling was accurate enough to be enjoyable.\nIt was tough while keeping the grind fair(for an expert pack), and it made good use of the various mods, having the recipes interconnected to progress.\nI had fun and I’ll be seeing you in another world!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "text": "Modpack Author: BoolymanMC\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.10.2 - Pack = 1.30\n\n\nPresentation\nI usually don’t play modpacks that are under at most 1.12, but this one was an exception because it seemed like it wanted to change how progression felt.\nFrom what I read, it’s going to be a difficult one, with a lot of focus on surviving against mobs. Let us enter the world of Sthenea to test our mettle!\n\n\nOverview\n\nWiped-Clean Slate\nRight as it begins, I get a class option quest, so I chose to be a ranger because I love the spider pet. It’s hard to keep up with all the things while mobs are out for your blood, I can barely grab some wood and get a house kit before the first night comes. Made the mistake of thinking mining during the night was safe, and going up had me greeted by several creepers destroying my shabby home.\n\n\n\nA mob of mobs, they don’t seem friendly.\n\n\nI had to resort to making a platform over lava to exploit mob AI and survive nights. Meanwhile I plant some things and my ores from simple mining help progressing to the next step - traps. I use plates and go through my first blood moon unscathed thanks to those, and some progression yields me turrets, which are really good!\n\n\n\nYou’ll never get me alive!\n\n\nProblem is, I use a flattener tool that nukes my current base… Back to ground zero. A somewhat desperate situation, but using the turret with cobblestone, I am protected well enough while the large plot of flat land is fully lit, reducing by a lot the mobs appearing. That gives me enough time and availability to make a smeltery which significantly increases ore yield. It allows me to upgrade my tools and I expand my base to prevent intrusions - full reinforced stone walling off.\n\n\n\nNot even the rumbling will get me now.\n\n\nAlso adding a colossal chest to solve storage for a while, I can focus on basic progression quests and blood magic slightly. I encounter a bottleneck in rare resources meaning I have to start mining but also branching off in new techs. A lucky expedition yields just enough lapis to make an armor workbench allowing me to make speed 2 boots, a good boost!\n\n\n\nThe base begins expanding more as I obtain power.\n\n\n\n\nSanguinomancy\nWhile waiting for some bricks to cook, I decide to go explore the outside and grab whatever I find. Starting with an essence pool that will allow me to begin Ars spells! I also spend several lives trying to explore an underground dungeon, ugh those suck, and I really need better lighting to prevent mobs from spawning constantly.\n\n\n\nI didn’t mean that…\n\n\nAfter sorting what I found, I can finish building the advanced blast furnace - steel is now available! I get the idea of making a tinker bow as well, this should cost me a lot less now with good ranged support - full mythril. Some quest rewards are pretty juicy, and I nab lapis seeds to stop being in constant need, and I also get an amazing spell from a bag! It costs me a high amount of mana for now, but it already seems very strong.\n\n\n\nStars rain from above!\n\n\nI got a treasure map earlier and the loot had some pieces of quartz, which was exactly what I needed to auto harvest my mystical plants. With that running, I also got just enough glowstone to reach a new altar tier, and I quickly go to tier 4 after getting some blood shards. I’ve got most of the quest line done, only remaining things are the special meteor rituals that would provide a high amount of precious resources.\n\n\n\nThe evolution from chickens. It’s getting bloody…\n\n\nBut for that, I need a huge amount of life points, which means I have to setup an automation of it. To do this, I need to obtain a magma cream, and the best way (not involving the nether) is to get a pulverizer. Dipping my toes in Thermal, I quickly realize I’ll need power, so I have to look at making thermopiles.\n\n\n\nThe forbidden quest.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Blood\nThinking the quests unlocked after would be related, I decide it’s time to battle against the first titan, the water titan! It takes me quite a while to realize it’s immune to most harm, but after some pondering, I brought a lava bucket and that did the trick. One down! The power quest tab is a bit disappointing since it doesn’t involve the simple means, oh well, time to ignore it and work on immersive engineering…\n\n\n\nWon as intended.\n\n\nI take the opportunity to make myself a decent revolver, a side option when my star shower can’t work. No more avoiding this time, if I want to be efficient, I have to make a metal press for wires and get power… But first, I install a drawer system with a controller - next level storage here we go! Having a much cleaner sorted system, I realize I had 3 blaze powders to easily get a magma cream, and the best part is that they can be duplicated through crafts with gold - even giving me access to real blaze rods all without going to the nether!\n\n\n\nThe base gets upgraded bit by bit.\n\n\nI can now finish the blood magic quest and get a powered spawner as reward, that’s going to be huge for automated blood and loot. I still need a good power source, and lack materials, so I decide to get more chests from the dungeon and somehow while going there an elite mob drops a draconic core. When I come back to the base, I see this can be crafted into a generator for cheap, hahahahaha!\n\n\n\nNo survivors, and no vampires.\n\n\nSince I have all the components, I start installing the spawner blood farm under the original one, encased in reinforced stone and with a fan to push them on the glass spikes. It works pretty well, so I just need to upgrade the altar with more runes so that it can fill the master orb for the ritual. Meanwhile, I get sidetracked by various bits of progression and end up with an ender IO alloy smelter, always handy.\n\n\n\nDrawing blood… marrow?\n\n\n\n\nDrawing Out from Space\nIt doesn’t take long to finish upgrading the runes, and now my LP are increasing effortlessly, I decide it’s time for a break from building and go clear out entirely a dungeon! The amount of loot is quite astronomical and I obtain many useful items, including most of the important mystical seeds.\n\n\n\nGame of Thrones is over, go away!\n\n\nWith some effort, everything is sorted and my giant drawer wall is big enough to handle all the item types, no more bottlenecks, it’s time for the meteor! It is a huge success, and I get so much essence from one meteor, I pretty much got infinite amount of high tier. While waiting for LP to refill, I improve my farm setup with 4 harvesters and make the infusion crystal even though I would barely need it now…\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall: The Return\n\n\nI have all I need to make most of the important resource seeds, truly a new era was ushered! I decide to spend my 2 onyx for my pickaxe head and fully upgrade her with useful modifiers and parts, using blood iron for the handle so it mends infinitely. I progress more in the quests and that makes the first tab completed, blood magic mastered! I can do a huge array of things now that most resources have been unrestrained, so I should focus on having power sources.\n\n\n\nThe components out of space.\n\n\nI said that, but I still had a handful more seeds to grow, and I wanted to have some sort of flight, so I do some grid power progression for the squid ring. Things have been going smooth so far, it’s worth unlocking the daily packages so that I can have access to all the trades and see a bit what I need to produce. I utilize my first trade to get a thorns XX shield, honestly quite disappointed with all the other options…\n\n\n\nThis strikes fear in a man. But I am no man.\n\n\n\n\nHigh Power Tensions\nI do a pseudo refined storage with ender IO, getting the sweet taste of centralized crafting - I really want to have a functional refined storage soon, but I need to stabilize my power production first. I make thermopiles, but wow how terribly disappointing, they don’t work.\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall strikes back.\n\n\nIt’s finally time to enter the Nether, I can’t keep postponing it. And I’m very glad I only went there now, because the mobs are just as obnoxious as ever and they’re constantly assaulting me. Thankfully my pseudo-flight and gear help a ton, and I can wring out most of the important resources from the dimension. I tried pumping lava, but the pump needs power… which is my fuel source for the dynamo - guess I’ll do a closed circuit first then it can fuel the rest.\n\n\n\nHow strange that lava ends up being a relief since it means less mobs…\n\n\nOn the side, I try to understand better how to make spells, but it’s all quite confusing and obtuse, still managing to make a mediocre projectile that can stand-in for Starshower underground. Powering the pump, it doesn’t seem to want to send any lava, I give up after a while and try the thermopiles again, and miracle they finally decide to work! Seems like I forgot that the energy cell had the bottom face set to output by default… Blutonium is incredibly effective, and 3 piles are already giving out several Krf/t - time to make a few more and have the supreme storage powered.\n\n\n\nWait… The Great Wall 2: Electric Boogaloo?\n\n\nThe great drawer migration concluded, and I realize I’m going to start lacking mass amounts of key materials, so before setting up heavy autocrafting, I have to make max stat seeds for manifold yield. The efficiency being so high, I’ll be able to get rid of my giant field, and hopefully reduce lag potential.\n\n\n\nThey keep trying.\n\n\n\n\nA Stick in the Wheels\nAfter a pause, I figured out I could upgrade my gear with levels… Guess I suddenly gained a huge power up, along with ars armor imbuing. During the long process of getting max stat seeds, I start producing enough for some daily packages, and I notice I can “cheese” my way through the infinity ingot recipe with cheaper ways skipping singularities.\n\n\n\nI should reconvert to farmer.\n\n\nThe liquid packages seem like a pain, so my goal will be to get the creative tank at earliest and completely skip those packages. First, I need to get the diamond seeds to make the crystal matrix ingots very easily, then the endgame crafts won’t seem that far away. The supplies already come in decently fast, and I use those uncommon runes to get IC2 end game crafters along with strong solar panels.\n\n\n\nThis is what you call a power move.\n\n\nThis way I can have it slowly produce more of the endgame package resources, at the same time I had to progress in thermal and basic IC2 machines to have easy access to components. Most of my time is taken by upgrading the important seeds, but on the way I make the extreme crafting table, biggest step reached - I’ll soon be able to get neutronium generated!\n\n\n\nI really should get better at base building…\n\n\nTo do that, I’ll require nether stars, which means a trip to the nether for the wither skeleton seeds. After that, things develop more, I install a phytogenic lane for fruit trees and my first star is generated! During an expedition to find cherries, I ended up getting a builder’s wand from a dungeon and… oh no, this is a broken item - it can create blocks as long as I have 2! This is going to help a lot, especially for infinity ingots and the rarer resources, although it won’t be that useful for the package metals - I need too many to be worth the manual effort when the seeds are already running.\n\n\n\nBarely used any of that in the end.\n\n\n\n\nRipping Through Reality\nHonestly, it’s a bit of a relief, because it will shorten the grind and make the experience less unpleasant - the modpack is interesting, but also has issues and lacks polish, understandably. My policy while playing modpacks is that I won’t use cheats (unless it’s required to fix a quest or similar), and beyond that, any method provided by the pack is fair game.\n\n\n\nI’m playing Harvest Moon, aren’t I?\n\n\nFor now, it’s mostly useful to cut down time on making the stars and mob loot, while all the seeds are active and I look into other package types. I need to find a jungle for a specific fruit tree so most of my time is spent roaming around, not having access to biome detectors.\n\n\n\nRight, those were a thing.\n\n\nI decide to progress the early quests more and fight off the earth titan. Then I got enough neutronium to duplicate itself and made all the infinity gear pieces thanks to the easy recipes! I pretty much “beat” the pack, and I barely fought the first 2 titans huh…\n\n\n\nInfini-stonks.\n\n\nI still have quests to clear out though, so onwards to the beneath! Little did I know, it would be the end of the run for me, as the sword of the cosmos irremediably corrupted the world after being swarmed by mobs during the mining session. In a way, this is a relief, the remaining grind wouldn’t have been very fun and I was getting fed up with the mob aggression…\n\n\n\nThose turrets didn’t even matter, used a frostball spell…\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWell then, guess that’s it. To be honest, this pack was strange - the relentless aggression felt too much at the start, then barely mattered later on (while being very obnoxious for exploration).\nI liked the ideas and narrative thread it had, and the endgame trades were a much more interesting reason to grind unlike the ad nauseam singularities in most packs. The issue was that they were poorly balanced and only a few trades were worth the effort.\nIt didn’t help that there were many issues and unpolished bits, so I would advise against trying the modpack, but I read about a newer version that could be more up to the task. It was a try that birthed a better version I’m eager to try one day!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "text": "Modpack Author: dreams01\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.12.2 - Pack = 1.53\n\n\nPresentation\nFate led me to try out another adventure pack, it’s a name I’ve seen quite a fair bit so this is fairly exciting to finally see what it is about!\nIt’s a fairly demanding pack, and it made me search and change my starting java arguments to improve the bottlenecked performance - here are them if you ever need for any reason.\n\n-XX:+UseG1GC -Xmx8G -Xms8G -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nSorting Out Plans\nI appear in a peaceful field, and take an entire day sifting through my starting items and quests - thankfully you’re given a starting home kit. There’s a thousand things to handle at once at the start, so I begin with the simplest: plant stuff. A weird inventory rollback bug keeps happening, but it seems like opening the baubles/another inventory avoids it.\n\n\n\nChoosing the pyramid style because I was feeling adventurous!\n\n\nMeanwhile the quests are very generous in level rewards, meaning I already have a substantial amount of passives from the levels mod. Barely keeping up with my inventory, my next step is getting a backpack, which isn’t hard due to getting leather from ground traps and loads of silk from a silkworm.\n\n\n\nTrying out the spartan arsenal.\n\n\nStill having trouble keeping up with all the open tabs, I’ll have to progress slowly and soon find global inventory management solutions. There doesn’t seem to be many options, so I first settle with a colossal wooden chest until I have more resources.\n\n\n\nI’ve learned to pay more attention to chunks when making my base.\n\n\nFor that purpose, I do several expeditions at the bottom of my mineshaft and come back with a varied and plentiful amount of ores. Those expeditions are also the good time to obtain a high amount of obsidian and initiate thaumcraft by collecting some crystals - I even found two crate stashes.\n\n\n\nI never used those before, but it seems very handy…\n\n\n\n\nA Seedy Place?\nI progress a bit then I look into mystical agriculture seeds to make it easier on the crafting. I got some shards so I can begin, but I have so little inferium essence, I have to grow higher tiers of seeds first. This has to be the first time I’m really limited in this mod’s progression, but that’s pretty fun in a way.\n\n\n\nMagic? Oh yeah, I do magic too with my bronze wand, it makes things disappear.\n\n\nTo improve my mystical yield, I have to progress in roots a bit, and for that I need moss which means exploring more. It’s really not hard to obtain and I make a handful of elemental soils - seed duplication here I come! While waiting for my inferium seed to grow, I go mine into the cavern dimension because I need lapis and quartz for simple storage.\n\n\n\nGravekeeper simulator.\n\n\nThe loot is abundant, and I even obtain a tree of time to boost crops more! I gathered enough materials to make the storage controller, it is time to finally centralize for access! Except that by now, you should know I’m a master at getting sidetracked… and I decided I absolutely needed to get glowstone first to make the knowledge scroll for storing my levels safely. This endeavor led me to a prolongated expedition, finding various useful things but nothing that really matters beyond the one glowstone in a far away village (which I didn’t even get to explore because I was full).\n\n\n\nHis sheep have run amok.\n\n\nNow that I have the precious scroll, I should explain more why it was so important: quests give out levels, not xp in amounts. Meaning that the higher your level is, the more xp you gain from redeeming a quest, and conversely the level up mod only uses 5 levels for each skill point. There is a weak point to exploit here by using the scroll and the experience book who stores xp in amounts, by stockpiling levels and absorbing all the quests then when it’s time to spend some you store it all away except the puny amount of the book, which trickles exactly as needed to level up or enchant by spending little before grabbing back the scroll. Truth is, I wouldn’t have needed to do these shenanigans if one quest didn’t force me into it; I’m supposed to make a filled demonic barrel of experience - that means 65 million experience, no other sane option but to exploit the level rewards.\n\n\n\nThe turnips stock market is crashing down.\n\n\n\n\nFarm and Fortune\nOnce this is done, I go into the nether… yeah I could’ve done that to begin with for the glowstone, but oh well, it was a good excuse to explore a bit. I don’t stay too long, mostly to grab nether bricks so I can make the demon ingots, then I come back and finally am back to the initial goal of having my better storage! I still setup my mystical and pam’s farm to full throttle with elemental soil first, then hook it all up to my colossal chest with a remote to access it all easily.\n\n\n\nUpgrading the repair station…\n\n\nA new era begins by figuring out the issues that were plaguing me since the start, meaning no more lag and fixing some quests not yet updated. This weight gone, I need automation to handle some of the honestly gigantic end goals, and for that purpose build a bigger colossal iron chest with the roof filled by hopper pots! With this solid system, I spend a lot of time making more seeds and tending the crops, while doing some expeditions when essence needs to be replenished.\n\n\n\nA non suspicious puppet in an abandoned circus? Seems safe.\n\n\nI find some strange things during my explorations, and after all this time I find a spectre coil, the graal of RF. I can now overhaul my crops with a faster and more efficient harvesting, and while waiting for some pam’s crops to finish I make some diamond armory to clear quests. The rewards of said quests ends up being insane, including a second spectre coil, a mega loot ring and 13 nether stars! The ring gives resistance for free, and after some research I upgrade it to also provide speed, this is so strong.\n\n\n\nIt’s becoming less laughable.\n\n\nI spent some extra time boosting my gear as well and the crops have calmed down quite a bit, I mostly need to increase them in numbers so that’s most of the intense production being handled - adventure awaits, huzzah! I begin by an expedition in the nether to gather the remaining blaze and wither skeleton chunks, along some extra treasures, and locating the queen ghast altar.\n\n\n\nThe wither stock market is crashing down too.\n\n\n\n\nDragon Warp\nAfter replacing some of the fruit trees, I find myself quite free to go on a longer exploration, but first I want to look at the dimensional door nearby. It’s a cute and short experience, and I decide to jump into the limbo, forgetting that when leaving the dimension you can end up anywhere…\n\n\n\nIt all happened on a rainy day.\n\n\nAnd that anywhere is face to face with a dragon! I forgot they were in this world, not seeing any for so long, thankfully I’m more than strong enough to crush him. Noticing a myrmex colony a few blocks next to the nest, I venture deeper when the ground crumbles and I get assaulted by a much bigger dragon!!! There was another nest right under the tunnel, and the dragon got lured by my presence.\n\n\n\nI unlocked my first shout!\n\n\nAlthough being in a terrifying situation, my bow dealt enough damage that I wasn’t in danger. Looting the nest yielded a meagre bounty; a handful of gear, but also 2 weezers out of the 10 needed. Very good in the end, along the last stand X enchants. Leaving the place, I find a frozen lake town with usual waystones and points, which make me understand I can easily travel all around through signposts, but also that I forgot the waystone gem doesn’t cost levels…\n\n\n\nI love this.\n\n\nComing back home with a very large bounty, notably of dragon remains and maps from a cartographer, it’ll take some time to sort out my gear and prepare for longer travel. I switch to ice dragon equipment, and play around with signposts near the 3 villages I managed to find, this is very useful for free instant travel. I use that time while waiting for souls to clear out some dimensional door gates and find some very nice loot.\n\n\n\nTruly out of this world.\n\n\n\n\nJuggernaut\nBack home, there are a lot of things to work on, I begin with relocating the fishing pool then completely rework my enchantments since I learned the cost didn’t increase so you can stockpile enchants freely! Now that I’m quite cracked, I go on another exploration spree and get more goodies, then back at home I splurge in the shop to get epic boxes and guess what? I obtain a super chestplate that has a built-in unlimited jetpack!\n\n\n\nA slice upgrade.\n\n\nThat requires more reworking of my gear, but it’s very worth the effort. While waiting for souls I grow the cockatrices I got from my egg farm - the plan is to use the familiar receptacle to resurrect the cockatrice and increase the kill count to 75 without effort! That was the plan, at least, but you can’t hurt your babies it seems. Instead I make the ocelot pet to get night vision and finish changing up all my enchanted gear, I’m now almost fully ready!\n\n\n\nI’m a bit hardheaded…\n\n\nI use a capsule that had chorus flowers to bypass the need of going to the end and get the dimensional remote, finally full access everywhere! Now that I got magic siphon on my sword, I can steal the buffs I’m missing, benefiting from the harder mobs to get infinite duration effects. I then go dig into the cavern dimensions and find what has to be the best mob hunting grounds, this is great!\n\n\n\nThat’s an interest pet… Too bad power is near useless here.\n\n\nTo empty my inventory, I quickly kill off the wither who became a joke with my gear, then I go explore a ton more following my temple maps. On the path, I find a big desert surrounded by a savannah edge, meaning I get to increase my kill count for numerous creatures like cockatrices and cyclops. I get sidetracked a bit by getting friendly with a myrmex colony and grabbing a lot of queen eggs - hopefully the strategy will work this time…\n\n\n\nReminds me of Hive.\n\n\nAlright, you might have noticed it already, but the last chapters were pretty much the same loop of exploration and tweaking stuff at the base - now I don’t even need to upgrade my gear anymore either. I’ve been reconsidering how doable some of the quests are, and at this point until the end of the pack it would be steamroll exploring to grind some numbers. I have to value my time more, and I don’t think this is beneficial for me to continue.\n\n\n\nStaring contest.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt’s a bit of an anticlimactic end, but it was necessary after I came to the realisation that the pack wasn’t for me.\nI enjoyed the drive to remove most automation and technology, leaving full range to be exploring and adventuring. It had so many mods, but they were far from necessary; the progression ending up way too open, and not really making use of the huge variety possible.\nIt seems like it would be fun for a server where people hang out, but for a quester it’s not as interesting. Once my gear reaches the tier of immortal, it’s a plateau.\nClearly it wasn’t what I expected, I learned a good lesson to be more attentive to what the pack is about before starting, so it was still an important experience to be had!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: CTMC\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.19.4 - Map = 1.0\n\n\nPresentation\nMapwreck 6 - Sunset to Sentience is a full length CTM map. It was made under a week with a high amount of participants which I was a part in.\n\n\nOverview\n\nMind/Matter - Monument\n\n\n\nWhere dreams end.\n\n\nThis has to be the hardest start of any map I’ve played, and that includes P2M, Horrifeye and Ragecraft 2. The death pits with the death system meant that your items would end up stuck at the bottom, and no easily accessible wood guaranteed many painful deaths. The spawners were too fast in those conditions. The whole underside was strange, aside some fine loot, it doesn’t lead anywhere and sort of feels like it’s here to punish you from exploring.\nHowever, the crunch pickaxe was so good I kept using it until it broke halfway in the map. The many many custom and strange item shops were a bit overwhelming, and it wasn’t clear enough how traits worked. I did end up using a good amount of gear from it even to the end(maybe too many of them considering how early you get some) like the arrow climbing, rose tinted glasses and the thorns sword. I really liked the progressive structure unlocking and it was ergonomic for moving around.\n\n\nScornful Shores - White\n\n\n\nToo late to evacuate.\n\n\nWas nice but too short, the path you arrive from directly starts you on the objective. Also unsure if it was intentional to have the blazes under rain, so they just died on their own.\n\n\nThe Tourist Trap - Orange\n\n\n\nGuaranteed fun for the whole family!\n\n\nQuite nice, not much to say about it. I failed to find anything with the treasure map.\n\n\nMountshroom - Magenta\n\n\n\nIt’sa me, yahoo.\n\n\nReally cool zone, big mario 64 vibes. The secret switch was a bit too cryptic for me to figure out, sorry. The bonus was too hidden as well. Loved jumping around and the sense of ascension was powerful.\n\n\nScarlet Spires - Light Blue\n\n\n\nBaguette team assemble!\n\n\nIt was a lot less difficult than what I heard about. The zombie swarm was easily manageable with the strength 2 potions and the runic knife doing a lot of work. The metabolic armor suffers from not having enough support to be worth using sadly. The other items are overall fine, some less useful than others. Mycogenesis is truly amazing.\nThe area itself was surprisingly not labyrinthic because of a clear path to follow to the end, despite not looking like it. Big Veiled Exodus vibes, but that was obvious coming from Baguette team. Aside the custom items, the loot was too filler, but I know what happened back then… Considering that, I’m pleasantly surprised by how well it played.\n\n\nMarauder’s Bay - Yellow\n\n\n\nDo what you want cause a pirate is free.\n\n\nThe progression layout was a bit weird (teleporter at the bottom, exit to the next area at the start, wool easily accessible by going forward), it was quite fun to explore for the one slice. Got to use the infiniflask for weakness with my metabolic axe to get on demand absorption.\nI liked the vertical drop centered in the area, giving a true pirate bay feel.\n\n\nFruition of Chaos - Pink\n\n\n\nYou don’t fight a brain here, sadly.\n\n\nI fell down there and survived thanks to evasion, so I did it before lime. I’m glad the palette was changed during production, because oh dear performance would suffer. It was an easily digestible area. The eyes were fun but the shulkers seemed to not do anything? I was afraid I’d get lost there but it didn’t happen.\nThe Great Escape was insanely good, so good it was used up till the end.\n\n\nRevolutionaries’ Hideout - Lime\n\n\n\nVive la france!\n\n\nI was getting lost a fair bit, it’s a very webbed area with many paths and entrances. The bonus dungeon was quite large, I remember the chaos during the mapping week, but it’s funny to see it ended up being made in time.\nIt was a fun area but a severe lack of baguettes. Le peuple a faim!\n\n\nArtificial Ascent - Gray\n\n\n\nDon’t stick your tongue out.\n\n\nThe key aspect was very light, it added something extra fun in the dungeon. The area was shorter overall, not sure why it’s named like that when there’s no ascent, sob. Did I mix up the name with Light Gray? At that point the loot felt weak, except the echo axe, damn it’s good.\n\n\nXenoarcheology - Light Gray\n\n\n\nYou can’t just blast a hole in the surface of Mars!\n\n\nI didn’t realize the new offhand I bought would disable melee attacks, so it was very painful since I wasn’t prepared with many ranged options yet. The area itself was probably fine but I was too struggling to really tell. I only had the Great Escape to fight. The shift between the cliff town and the futuristic facilities felt a bit strange, like it’s different areas.\n\n\nThe Cliffhangers - Cyan\n\n\n\nHaunted mine ride.\n\n\nIt was unfortunate that the time of day broke the sky color and some mobs, it also happened in some other areas. Other than that, it played a lot better than I thought, with the aside that I really should’ve used a few chests for inventory dumping. The gear and loot sadly was already outclassed, except the possessed longbow which ended up as my main weapon for a while. It was fun to explore around after a year, even if I couldn’t forget where everything was placed.\n\n\nSerpent’s Awakening - Purple\n\n\n\nIt hides more than it seems.\n\n\nThis area was quite an experience. The dragon, while very cool, was very very laggy. It lagged so much I lost the infinity potion and I would fail jumps. I was making full use of the crossbows and my possessed longbow, for once I was glad Pear and Red have an obsession with crossbows. The lubricant bow didn’t do anything sadly, and the resistant spearmen were very annoying and often led to instadeath falls because of lag.\nDespite the issues it was still a pretty fun area and the berries were a good bonus to hunt for.\n\n\nTomato Towers - Blue\n\n\n\nThis is a strawberry cake, change my mind.\n\n\nI would get instakilled by the magic vex because of the closed space. Other than that it was a breath of fresh air after the many complex and difficult to navigate areas. It made me realize there was a very low amount of structured interior areas in this map. The loot tomatoes everywhere were probably a bit too much and my poor inventory belched.\n\n\nTrials of Time - Brown\n\n\n\nMy reaction to this area.\n\n\nUnfortunate that the lag made the experience go from interesting to unbearable. I died more times at the end than every other area combined, that includes the monument and purple’s instadeath falls. Not a fan of the ultimate creepers considering I almost lost the objective because of them and it made the jumps harder when lag already made it painful. It was a suitable area for my adhd agility 6 build so that part was fun.\n\n\nDarkstone Peak - Green\n\n\n\nAn aurora borealis? At this time of the day?\n\n\nIncredible area for ranged builds, layout was great too. Got an unbreakable infinity power 3 sharpshoot bow, wowowow. Most of the loot is super vanilla though, which makes it suffer compared to the rest of the map. Damage scaling is starting to go a bit off the charts - hi instant death ghasts.\n\n\nHyakki Yagyo - Red\n\n\n\nMy reaction to this rising sun.\n\n\nRed looks quite pretty and a flavorful theme. the loot is very power crept sadly, with one surprising exception for the yoichi bow which was incredible despite what I already had. The kitsune archers were interesting, but maybe too easy to counter since the player goes fast at that point. I still remember the skeleton king in devil world finale, and it’s great to see it back well integrated in the level layout!\n\n\nThe Farm - Black\n\n\n\nMy life is potato.\n\n\nLink area to its full glory. It was quite fun although any melee hit just one shot me at this point. Loot once again felt too filler despite having some fun unique things. Custom models and sounds added to the vibe. The boss was cool even though I had to do it almost hitless if I wanted to win. Aside the boss, I was full on stomper with the purple crossbow and the farm shook in my wake.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe 2 areas I contributed in… what were the chances.\n\n\nWhat a map… many experimental things in this one, some good, some less, a lot of overuse.\nThere was quite a big design gap with areas that had somewhat standard gear and mobs, and some that had everything super custom. The three final areas especially feeling that difference. The gear balance was buried alive, with the monument, purple and blue being major spikes of cornerstone gear. I liked the infiniflasks, although there weren’t many designs exploiting the variety of debuffs, so they felt too weak compared to the explosion of stuff. Which led to inventory management being a pain. Way too much loot and drops, and carto heads/d.i.e.s. overuse exacerbated the issue.\nI loved the area title cards, put in creative ways. The less fun part was lag, so much lag. Too much of everything, and most notably all the areas being cramped with each other made it a major problem. I love interconnected areas, but this was too much. It’s telling that I wasn’t able to take most areas in a screenshot without showing other ones. The moment to moment gameplay during the areas was overall quite fun though, probably the best success of the map, good area designs! The bonus hints were too unclear, not even sure if they were hints or area descriptions.\nThe many issues make me sad, because I know how much effort was given to make and release the map. It was still a fun experience in its own way, but it would have been better without the bad parts. The style was on point, but the substance too rich.\nAre mapwrecks forever bound to be cursed? Time will tell."

    "text": "3 is a familiar numeral, be it this symbol or another, its concept is as old as humanity and comes to represent much more.\n\nThe Magic\nIt’s not difficult through a simple search online to find many uses and meanings from that number which reveal some uniqueness to it. Mathematicians and physicists will know how essential it can through things like primary colors, the stability of the triangle, the observable dimensions, algebraic quirks, etc… It’s also prevalent in religion, although I won’t delve much deeper due to the amount and variations. All this can give a certain aura to it, and can lead to wonder: why is this number seemingly so important and magical?\n\n\nAn interpretation\nOf course, what I’m going to say is only an interpretation I made of it. Believe me or not.\n3 is the basis of knowledge. 1. Discover 2. Understand 3. Master Then you build on it as each new mastered point becomes a step; it represents the endless pursuit of knowledge, leading you to enlightenment(apotheosis). 123 123 123, 333, or 3 6 9. The squared process of learning is but the first step. It’s the basis of all creation.\nSince the very beginning, we have used it as calibration when counting, either to or from 3. Subconsciously, it was already a meaningful concept from where everything else birthed from, and even beyond our mind it stays the essence of world rules to evolve.\n\n\nSynthesis\nIn the end, whether or not you give it importance, this number stays as closest to origins/god/perfection and I hope reading this helped broaden a bit your perception of the concept. The magic is there, only up to us whether we see it or not."

    "title": "Walking Through Elden Ring",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Game Author: FromSoftware\nOrigin: Steam Link\n\n\nPresentation\nElden Ring is the years-long awaited FromSoftware game, not a sequel to Dark Souls while still having lots of similar elements.\nHighly anticipated, this is going to be amazing I can feel it. The great adventure begins!\n\n\nOverview\n\nA New Leaf\nI’ve taken some time in the controls and settings before starting to ensure I’ll have the best experience(barely any change needed after all), then I carefully look at my choices and pick Astrologer as a starter class. I’ve played a curved blade and bow wanderer in the first dark souls, a heavily armored, tower shield, crossbow and axe knight in the second, and finally a spear/bident miracle herald in the third. It was time to delve into the spells! I chose the stone keys to start with, can always be useful for exploration, and then set off for the wilds!\n\n\n\nReady to face off the world.\n\n\nAfter some neat introduction, I get smashed by the first encounter, but then realize it was scripted… sortof. I’m still a bit rusty and I never really used spells in combat before except for healing myself, so this will be a climb from the bottom once again. Bring it on! I first go into the tutorial path, and fail miserably to parry any hit, so I just ditch the shield for now and focus on using my spells to win encounters.\n\n\n\nBackstabs as jubilating as ever.\n\n\nAfter clearing the path, I immediately find a stone lock. Lucky choice I made it seems, until I have to face deadly corridors with a doom engine pursuing me. I’m too weak to handle the ghosts ambushing me for now, so I give up after a few deaths. I put a marker on the map, handy feature, and set off to explore the brave new world awaiting… I never thought I’d live to experience that, I’m tearing up a little. Taking my time strolling around and collecting ingredients from the wildlife, this feels strange, a bit like dark souls, but also not.\n\n\n\nDon’t ask me why, I can’t even remember.\n\n\nI need to get back my rolling reflexes, meanwhile I fell it using my spells and notice it takes more damage in the head. Localized damage is really nice, this’ll be fun later on. That giant is a true rune(the new currency instead of souls) piñata and it’s worth killing while passing by. I scavenge the beach, see some weird magical tracks, and buy some crafting recipes from a merchant tucked away, nice. When turning back, I find a crack in the cliff and it leads me to a dark cave with a grace, I’ll come back to it later on as it’s impossible to explore yet. Going in the direction of the next main spot, I encounter the first boss and walk around it after getting spanked a few times.\n\n\n\nTriple kill!\n\n\n\n\nRuinous Path\nThe ruins were unexpectedly good, with another merchant(on which I promptly spent my runes to buy all the unique items and a torch) and I get the ability to craft items on the fly. I also find a station to upgrade my gear, sadly I need shards first but this will be useful! Using the torch, I try exploring the dark cave once again, and it works! Until I get demolished by a boss, time for a tactical retreat. All this time, I’ve been diligently reading all items descriptions, I want to enjoy it to the fullest! I notice a strange statue directing me to a side path, which ends up being a dungeon. I fight off some mean stone imps and obtain my first spirit summon, although I don’t have the bell yet.\n\n\n\nMy first boss kill!\n\n\nInteresting, seems like these small dungeons are indeed small dungeons to clear off with a teleporter back to the entrance. I got lucky and dropped another shard before, so I start by upgrading my staff, then I proceed towards my main goal. I touch the grace near the Stormgate, encounter Melina(what seems to be my companion for the game), then gain the ability to level up and horse riding. I clear out the ruins next to it making use of the stealth mechanic, which for some reason doesn’t make you detected after using sorceries(only the hit enemy will). At this point, you’d think I would go through the main gate, but sidetracked is my second name, and I go clear out several small dungeons I postponed before. Some expeditions less successful than others, but I find the path to a dragon island at least. The Tree Sentinel and the death trap ruins will wait.\n\n\n\nGank squad, assemble!\n\n\nWhile running through the bottom of a crevice, I get my first NPC invasion and as you’d guess I got trashed. After a tough rematch, I fell it and obtain his strong dagger. I haven’t yet found a better gear piece suited for me, gotta keep exploring. Then on the same path, a dungeon leads me to fighting Patches, who I obviously spare. This guy’s a real gem, and now I’ve got a nice shop to access.\n\n\n\nNo sane person would harm this beautiful.\n\n\nReaching the end of the crevice, it opens in the small swamp near the start, and the home to a tough boy. It takes me some tries to fight off Agheel, and after some epic horseback arcane shooting, it dies. Hitting the head deals a lot more damage, without it I wouldn’t have had any hopes to do it but it still drained all my FP and cerulean flasks. With the swamp drained, I can access several points of interest so I begin with a mine which yields me a lot of smithing shards. I’m able to upgrade my staff even more, sweet! Not enough to have a better sword yet, but it’s progress.\n\n\n\nElden: Combat Evolved\n\n\n\n\nTo Hell and Bark\nAfter this, I clear out the ruins in the middle of the swamp, open the chest and… it’s a teleport trap into a deadly crystal mine. Oh no, oh no no no, this is a problem. The guards, shrimp or centipede, are very deadly, and I painstakingly manage to reach the entrance after finding a new sorcery staff and spell. Sadly the staff is worse in terms of intelligence scaling so my dps goes down if I try to use it. The spell seems to be a strong crowd control, so maybe it’ll come in handy against swarms(spoilers, it sucked).\n\n\n\nI want to go home…\n\n\nExiting the nightmare mine, I end up in a worse place, a hellish bog of crimson rotting corruption. I need to find a site of grace to be able to leave this place. After dying to invisible casters and clearing out weird golem balls, I figure out there was one just across the exit of the mine. Seems like it’s safe to cross on horseback, so I go there and oh dear, now I get transported to the roundtable hub after sitting. It will be my main base in this game huh, alright. This time I really am back to the starting area, the trap ended up being a lot more than I thought.\n\n\n\nDouble damage from int scaling after putting it on my sword, woohoo!\n\n\nWith my newfound strength, I go and manage to defeat the Tree Sentinel after a hard fought battle. What was keeping me behind is defeated, I walk proudly to the Stormgate to proceed on the adventure. The first thing I find after clearing the blockade is my first flask increase, this was oh so long overdue! I also obtain a neat jellyfish summon and end up helping the Iron Fist, or Mr Potman as I like to call him.\n\n\n\nBiting the dust is necessary sometimes.\n\n\nToo tough for now, I go explore the east side of the map. Starting by getting lost in the woods, I go to the map fragment so I can navigate better then promptly get mauled by a giant bear. While getting back up to the eastern cliffs before the forest I hadn’t finished exploring, I encounter my first convoy which I promptly clear out. A weapon I can’t use, whatever. I find the sorcery merchant in the lower level of ruins on the side, finally after all this time!\n\n\n\nDamned autotarget!\n\n\n\n\nWanderlust\nSadly most of the available spells seem bad compared to my starting one, but the scroll I found earlier unlocks a really good slashing spell. Ever since I switched out to a rapier I was lacking broader strikes, so now I can cover more ground! During my search in the forest, I find and progress some NPC questlines. First is some werewolf warrior that asked me to find a traitor, then I helped a noble reclaim his ruined castle. I end up going down an elevator in the middle of the forest, and what I find is beyond all that I was expecting.\n\n\n\nBlackreach, is that you?\n\n\nAfter I obtain the map fragment, I leave to finish clearing the forest and find both a flask upgrade and a special flask! Would you look at that, a teleporter gate that sends me… oh dear, even farther away than last time. Although I’m thankful that it’s not directly hostile territory and there’s even a grace, perfect. Getting quite close to having all of the beginning area covered, I first go upgrade my weapons once again. After this, I clear out the border and go meet Patches again, who’s got a nice chest for me. It sends me in the middle of the giant bears in the misty forest, heh, too bad I already cleared this place. I know how to leave safely!\n\n\n\nI slay thee, vile spawn of evil!\n\n\nThen I cleanse a ruined town from an undead barge, and loot a stamina regen charm, very useful. Ever since I started using the slice sorcery, I switched back my staff to the right hand and stay with a shield at all times. That’s proving to be a good idea seeing as my rapier is able to safely poke while blocking. I found an ash of war merchant and bought the parry one, so my shield can even parry now! I never expected I’d end up parrying with my build, although I still enjoy slicing and shooting away.\n\n\n\nSurprise, it was me!\n\n\nOnwards to the main castle! While going there, I sidetrack quickly to defeat the crucible knight using a running away tactic and I get a new incantation. Too bad I can’t use these… After all this time, I enter the first story boss fight… very long overdue indeed. The fight ends up being really easy while Aurelia(that’s the name of my jellyfish summon) tanks and drags the aggro back every time. I even forgot I had the shackles item to hinder him.\n\n\n\nMy flame shall light the world aflame by its bright!\n\n\n\n\nCastling Away\nThe gatekeeper felled for good, the castle conquest begins. It’s a long and arduous ordeal with lots of twists and turns, I failed to find the grace spots until many deaths. The good news is that I found a sorcery related merchant for ashes of war, I upgraded my weapon skill to a giant sword. I clear out a bridge of three golems and find a blocked door, guess it’s not the right place.\n\n\n\nNo more bolts for you!\n\n\nTurning back, I find the boss fog but instead take the other way into the depths and end up fighting an enraged tree boss monster in close quarters. Considering my very squishy build, I was at a loss on how to survive and beat it, until I realized I didn’t need to keep wearing the same clothes from the start as long as I stayed under a threshold of weight. The epiphany saving me from pain, I now wear exile armor parts and more than doubled my poise and armor ratings. I’ve also switched to a metal shield, so blocking is worthwhile even against those scary monsters. I never imagined my astrologer build would be strong enough to fight like that, but I guess I underestimated it by doing tunnel focus on sorcery.\n\n\n\nTriumph rains over…\n\n\nIt’s like I got stronger despite not getting an actual upgrade! The castle is taken, the king is in check, it’s time for the mate… Is what I thought, but it looks like Godrick is even stronger than Margit as a wallcheck. Sidetracking is the way to go I suppose, to Caelid! Willingly going back to the nightmarish hell, this side is surprisingly a lot more fun. Maybe it’s because I started using my shield but it’s fun riposting with the rapier and stunning even the giant dog monsters.\n\n\n\nThe red riding hood lost in the woods.\n\n\nExploring the rotting plains yields interesting finds and fights, with some really strong crow abominations and funny firethrowing machines you have to backstab. This is also where the entrance to a mine is, leading back to our friend Mr Potman stuck behind a door.\n\n\n\nHave no fear, I shall ward off evil.\n\n\n\n\nSlumbering Decay\nNext stop is a fortress on the southern end. It’s heavily guarded and I have a field day using stealth to take down the barricades. Atop is another teleporter which sends me to the very south end of the region next to another fortress right under fire. After a run for my life, I find a grace then leave because I won’t go there yet.\n\n\n\nSpin me right round, right round.\n\n\nConsidering my strength now, I feel confident enough to go clear out the very first dungeon that was so difficult. Still an ordeal, but with my new skills(irl) and levels, I was able to take down the abominations lurking. Clearing out loose ends in the explored plains, I never expected I would find my first suitable weapon for my build, the sword of st. Trina. The stats aren’t shying from my current weapon(even if the int scaling is a bit worse) but the real power is from the passive bonus to build up sleep on hit. This feels so strong and fun, I don’t think I’ll go back to the rapier.\n\n\n\nThe sandman has come. Sleep forever, little child…\n\n\nI thought I was relieved from things yet to clear and the game threw at me a hard cave that requires a way to cure rot or I can’t even reach the boss. After dying some, I just had to give up for now since I can’t craft the item needed but I don’t mind it, can’t clear everything too easily. To compensate I explored the southern end and defeated a great decaying dragon after many tries.\n\n\n\nYou’re gonna have a bad time simulator.\n\n\nHe was guarding a draconic church ruin, with many new incantations available to trade. A bit further down the road is the map for the area, I can finally see where I am and where to go! On the road, I face off against the Night’s Cavalry and after some epic jousting, I knock him off his horse. A bit further is a deadly death bird that I’m far from able to defeat yet.\n\n\n\nThis will be your last ballad.\n\n\n\n\nThrowing the First Rock\nGoing south I intrude a battlefield of knights and monsters, I decide to let them fight it off to reap the battered victors like plucking a flower. Struggling still as much against the crows, I reach a small dungeon with a boss that makes them look like final bosses. Deciding to not take over the defended fort yet, I go clear the swamp in the center and find what might be the best items for my build. Not only is there the strongest staff I’ve ever seen(S int scaling!) but there also is a new good spell to throw rocks at enemies.\n\n\n\nContinue, gentlemen.\n\n\nI upgraded the rare summon Oleg I got some time ago(from the first dungeon) and now I feel like all these upgrades will skyrocket my fighting strength, it’s time to test it out. My first fight is a bit of a disaster, but my dps clearly increased. The second fight is the boss of the mines I was sent from the first trap long ago, the size is perfect to test out the rock sling and while the numbers are slightly lower than the pebble, it is able to break poise from range.\n\n\n\nThe holy wand of salvation.\n\n\nBeing more comfortable with it, I put it to good use against the death bird that gave me so much trouble. With such conclusive results, I set off to take over the south fortress. The infiltration is quite fun and nerve-racking due to the lack of checkpoints. But the respite is short lived, since the boss is right after, and it’s another duo with an old friend. I’m not scared though, as I have a friend on my own now. It’s a tag team battle! Thus ends the fortress invasion, as it seems like I need to come back later.\n\n\n\nChaaaarge!\n\n\nI go up north through the town of sorcerers and make quick work of the boss there, I almost feel sorry for them. Past the city, I get brutally shot down by a trio of bosses I can’t even seem to damage. But that was a dead end, so I just mark it and go look at the upper half of Caelid. It’s filled with dragons and the monsters one shot me, ugh, I quickly grab the map and postpone this place.\n\n\n\nThis place smells of Heresy.\n\n\n\n\nInsulary Penance\nSeeing how much stronger I got, I went to finish what I started and crushed Godrick using all my means. I didn’t want to take risks since I wanted to keep the npc summon alive and this was a total success! That way I could continue her storyline safely(I learned way later that it doesn’t matter anymore).\n\n\n\nMy first great rune.\n\n\nSpeaking of storylines, I finally know the goals, I have 4 more targets to aim for. I set my sights on the Weeping Peninsula, as exploring is the current necessity. I’m a bit destabilized because of how strong I am now that I go into a lower level area. Maybe Caelid was too early for me to go into, huh. Seeing how I bully bosses now, I tried to fight the weakest ones with only my sword to make it closer to an even fight.\n\n\n\nHow big will this map get?\n\n\nThe vistas around look refreshing after Caelid and with so many tough bosses in a row, it’s pleasing to have lots of exploration unimpeded. I’m having fun training my close combat skills against the minor bosses(to various degrees of effectiveness) in the area. With everything else done(and another Death Bird), I can go take over the ruined castle in the south. The boss there is a pushover, although my level and the helper certainly play into it.\n\n\n\nA place for wandering souls.\n\n\nThe peninsula adventure ends with a sad note as the girl that sent me to the castle is found dead. Next is the north, past the Limgrave castle, into the watery bog. It’s a vast expanse with fog everywhere, making exploration tougher.\n\n\n\nBreathtaking vistas…\n\n\n\n\nKnee-Deep in Scholarship\nI learned how to stop poison and rot from being crippling using the flask of wondrous physick to gain passive healing, and that means I’m able to take revenge on the last bosses I couldn’t defeat before. Seeing how vertical the revealed area is, I decide to follow the shore up to the very north.\n\n\n\nFinding another mausoleum on the way.\n\n\nThe very top is a ravine that leads me to a cliffside dungeon with harpy siren monsters that have an amazing voice. The final chamber homes a deadly dragon but sometimes I don’t want to deal with them face to face. Defeating it opens the path to a new area, oops, I didn’t intend to progress like that.\n\n\n\nOutlasted the rot with the flask, ha!\n\n\nGoing back to the roundtable, I notice one NPC left and another one is leaving, oh no… was this a mistake? There’s even a weird corrupted knight in the aisle now. No use worrying now, what’s done is done, I’ll finish what I started and clear the remaining parts of Liurnia. Patches returned and I interact with a few more npcs scattered around, but the main place to visit is now the academy.\n\n\n\nHogwarts?\n\n\nThe black hole spell ends up being quite useful at times, and at the bottom of the giant waterwheel is the iron virgin monster that Patches mentioned before. Expecting a troll, I still let myself eaten and to my surprise, I do really end up in the volcanic manor. After some tense moments to avoid losing my runes, I manage to go back to the academy and proceed to the boss. I’m having a lot of fun in this place so far, and I even found a cool new shield.\n\n\n\nI wonder if I’ll meet Bowser here…\n\n\n\n\nGoing Over the Moon\nRennala ends up being a very cinematic boss that’s cooler than hard, another big step done. I start clearing a bit the west side of Liurnia and find a half token in a hidden village. Going back to the roundtable, I get assaulted but defeat the attacker. Apparently the cause was the half token I found earlier, and I learn where the other one is, neat.\n\n\n\nI banish thee, fallen knight.\n\n\nI finish exploring the west of Liurnia with a sideventure into the 4 belfries that seem to send me to random places with boss monsters(with a revenge) and just snapshots of the scenery. I guess it’s a way to show those places exist before you go there, that’s pretty smart huh.\n\n\n\nIs this the end of the world?\n\n\nI get stuck in front of a manor that’s cut off by a deadly spell, so I fully clear the rest of Liurnia instead. After some tribulations, I end up in front of the great lift that I can’t access for now. Going back to the roundtable, I show an item I got from a side boss and it starts a quest that sends me to the manor, guess I’ll go there after all!\n\n\n\nLittle did I know…\n\n\nIt’s very misty and hard to see, with spooky hand monsters and ghosts everywhere. Atmosphere is on point, and the boss ends up being pretty cool as a showdown between spellswords. Past the gate, there’s a dragon that somehow vanishes after bopping it a few times and I meet Ranni, the objective of my quest. Discussions ensue and my next goal is to go explore the underground area under the misty woods, perfect timing!\n\n\n\nOpportunity strikes at all times.\n\n\n\n\nStar of Extinction\nIt was long overdue, and it ends up being smaller than I expected, but with a very pleasing level design. I’m told that I need to defeat Radahn, perfect, I was wondering how to do that for a long while now! I meet up old friends as we prepare for the great festival and it finally begins…\n\n\n\nWhen the winged hussars arrived, coming down they turned the tide…\n\n\nThis is probably the hardest battle I’ve had to do, not because the boss is too strong, but because I want to keep Mr Potman alive during the fight. The great foe is felled, I now have 3 great runes out of the 5 I know of. I go to the tower to activate his rune, and find a deadly boss at the bottom, but rock sling proves its worth. That spell is a lifesaver against nimble or big enemies, despite the lower efficiency to cost ratio.\n\n\n\nI’ve come to gift you eternal rest.\n\n\nAfter this, I have to finish what I started and clean up the rest of the dragonbarrow. It’s a great place to gain runes, but randomly slipping made me lose 200K runes, ugh… Meanwhile a boss got stuck on a tree and died on its own from fall damage, I was wheezing pretty hard.\n\n\n\nNothing can save you now.\n\n\nAnother place cleared, I burrowed into the other underground place, this time with giant ants and more mudmen. The end of the tunnels lead me to a dead end but the boss was guarding a legendary item, the last stage material for special summon ashes! Past this, I activated the great lift since I found the second medallion half during my exploration of the dragonbarrow.\n\n\n\nThis place smells like death and agony.\n\n\n\n\nProgression Plateau\nGreat time to go into the Altus Plateau, I’m greeted by a dragon that goes away after being smacked a few times, how familiar. I faced him off again later and took him down for good, sightseeing went well.\n\n\n\nWhen the winged hussars arrived, coming down the mountainside…\n\n\nThe plateau leads to the Mt Gelmir, which is my next destination. There I find an amazing spell, Comet Azur. A costly death ray and, would you believe it, a bit later I loot a crystal tear for the flask that allows a short window where I don’t spend FP for spells. Finally unleashed the true strength of the sorcery build(although I don’t really like using it, too cheesy)!\n\n\n\nUltralaser!\n\n\nWith my newfound power, I enter the Volcano Manor feeling like I deserve to explore it this time. I scour the place and demonstrate my new abilities to the fullest, but then the big boss of the place requires to use a special weapon, damn! I’m also unsure if I should defeat him that soon because I’m doing tasks for the residents of the manor faction… I guess I should postpone his defeat for now and direct myself to the capital.\n\n\n\nCome into me.\n\n\nThe best place in the world! Or so they say, but the outer circle is an old battlefield. A tomb nearby holds a nerve wracking boss, and after defeating golem archers and a sentinel guarding the path, I enter the city proper. I quickly go take down a forgotten dungeon after getting the grace, then I make my way through the buildings of the inner town.\n\n\n\nI have become the hunter.\n\n\n\n\nCapital Punishment\nIt’s a fairly labyrinthic place(including the sewers) and exploring thoroughly is more difficult than expected, but progress is being made. Reaching the boss of the place, I can summon Melina to assist in battle and the fight goes smoothly. Little did I know this would be the last time we would be allies, because not long after, I go through the underground to reach the place where the Three Fingers reside.\n\n\n\nWe shall meet again…\n\n\nI meet Hyetta, the maiden-to-be I helped before, and decide to touch the three-fingers as asked. What happens I did not expect, I’m now the Lord of Chaos and she becomes my finger maiden, but even more surprising is that Melina swears to kill me before departing. Entropy is inevitable regardless of the world huh…\n\n\n\nOh dear, we’re in trouble.\n\n\nSomething irremediably changed, as my allegiance did… Not like there’s a choice now, I might as well delve in deeper. Deeproot is a strange but fun place, and the surprise is that it has a path leading to the previous underground, leading me to where I didn’t know how to get to.\n\n\n\nLost lands.\n\n\nI successfully survive the painful lake of rot, find the last item needed to fully upgrade Oleg and fight off a scary looking void legend, the sidetracking has come to an end. I reach the next step in my journey to the forge of giants after clearing the path to another great lift, icy mountains are next!\n\n\n\nThe penultimate region!\n\n\n\n\nPeak Exploration\nThe path to the top is rough and after defeating some strong foes, I find the last contract I’d been asked to do for the Volcano Manor. Since I’ve done all the requests now, I decide it’s the right time to defeat Rykard. As expected, all the residents leave once this is done, I’m glad I didn’t do it prematurely.\n\n\n\nDouble trouble.\n\n\nThis is all over, the five original shardbearers are defeated, I have to go conquer the castle Sol now. On the way, I get to see a touching reunion with Aurelia and her sister going stargazing. The castle itself isn’t particularly difficult and it ends up being a pleasant experience if you exclude the moment I get blindsided by a double ballista bait to get promptly skewered.\n\n\n\nI’ve kept my promise…\n\n\nI obtain the other part of the secret medallion and proceed to the east part of the mountaintops smoothly. It holds many monstrosities but my trusty sword is more than up to the task, and I find a rare dragon stone to upgrade an item to the final tier! Before reaching the highest point, I decide to go back and use the secret medallion on the great lift, exploring runs in my blood after all and I get a feeling that we’re approaching the end.\n\n\n\nOh no, no no no no.\n\n\nWhat I find in the end doesn’t disappoint, a giant field with more dungeons and things to loot, this is the final part of the map uncovered. I have to make it last. I noticed a while ago that the underground bit was missing a last half, and I was remembered of it unexpectedly. Tucked between giant trees and rune bears, a bloodied warping gate sends me to the remaining part of the underground, finally all the secrets are unveiled!\n\n\n\nOminous place.\n\n\n\n\nBloodied Flame\nDuring my leveling up, I increased my carry weight a bit to switch to a better armor, it looks even cooler! I also took that time to finish upgrading my sword and shield using the top tier materials obtained earlier. True to my habits, I then have to clear out the snow field, and end up having some fun taking revenge on those damned invisible assassins. I’ve now access to the Haligtree area, seems like this is where I’ll find Malenia.\n\n\n\nVanquish the vermin!\n\n\nBut first I find that I completely missed the giant comet crater in Limgrave, that’s pretty embarrassing when I even passed by once and didn’t notice it. I decide to go finish the mountaintops before exploring the crater and find a fun adversary to take down. With only the forge to go in, I can consider it done and go hunt in Nokron, the bosses there being tuned for way earlier. It allows me to progress slightly the Ranni questline, but I’m pretty sure it’s already a dead end after Rogier died…\n\n\n\nWelcome to Nokron, the forgotten land…\n\n\nWith only 2 options remaining, I start with Mohgwyn, the hellscape with blood everywhere. It’s easily the most stressful area I had to clear out, with a huge part that has no grace or stake and a ton of tricky and deadly enemies to defeat. It’s been a long while since I’ve felt frustrated but I definitely felt it again after losing once again 200K runes and still not seeing the end of the place.\n\n\n\nSpirit of the hunt.\n\n\nBut with enough determination, I fell the crow monstrosities and clean the rest up to the grace. The amount of runes obtained from the basic enemies more than makes up for the trouble and I’m able to level up quite a bit with all the stockpile. The boss feels too brutal to mess around, so I use all the tricks I have to survive and beat him successfully.\n\n\n\nThis was a true purgatory.\n\n\n\n\nPain in the Ash\nThat makes another shard bearer down, and this is the right moment to go take down the remaining one, onwards to the Haligtree! Oh boi, I wasn’t expecting this place to be ever nastier than Mohgwyn, but it kept me on my toes even more. Thankfully after chunks of tough content to plough through, there are graces that make it rewarding to finally pierce the blockades.\n\n\n\nWowie, that’s quite the map!\n\n\nAlthough the real tsunami arrives, Malenia is hard as steel and forces me to change up completely my playstyle and gear to have a hope of defeating her. And then, surprise! She has a second phase with a whole new health bar, aaaaaaaah! I need a pause so I go clear up some loose ends in NPC quests, completing the Ranni questline which I didn’t expect I could continue at this point.\n\n\n\nChaos has no allegiance…\n\n\nAfter enough distractions, the time has come to take down the hardest boss I ever fought in Fromsoft games, on par with Artorias… Yeah no, I think it’s even harder, I’ll come back another time. I decide it’s smarter to upgrade my stats first and even change my staff for a stronger one with carian sorceries. It’s also way stronger when maxed!\n\n\n\nLearning absolute dominance.\n\n\nUnless there’s another surprise area, I enter the final area of the game, a chaotic crumbling place full of ruins. It’s still very tame after all the previous stuff I went through and still waiting for me, I defeat the main boss of the area(an actual Artorias wannabe) fairly easily.\n\n\n\nFighting illusions.\n\n\n\n\nBroken Blade\nThe capital is now buried in ashes, damn I didn’t expect this to happen. But that doesn’t prevent me from going back to hell, Malenia is waiting… Like a gift from the heavens, an update came during the night with a whole heap of buffs to sorceries, mainly cost reductions but also some damage boosts. This completely changed the paradigm and after switching around my sorceries, I found a good setup.\n\n\n\nI am the flame…\n\n\nAll the tears dried up, the victory is jubilatory even though I lost all my rune arcs to naught. Artorias found its match, that was a long while since I struggled this much, but that’s why I like Fromsoft games. Back on track, there’s an extra optional boss left before the end of the game, so I make quick work of it. Everything feels easy after Malenia.\n\n\n\nPut these foolish ambitions to rest.\n\n\nThe end is near, and I’m near the end, time to wreck havoc and bring chaos! Walking around the buried ruins of the capital, I get stopped by Gideon who was originally the person guiding my steps, how nostalgic.\n\n\n\nYou know nothing, Gideon Ofnir.\n\n\nKnowing the goal is close at hand, I decide to have some fun with the penultimate boss. After his introduction and second phase, I can’t help but want to beat him mano a mano, for honor! He’s a really fun fight and now I’m ready for the final showdown.\n\n\n\nI am the world…\n\n\n\n\nPyrotheosis\nThe culmination of all the effort it took to reach, the last battle has rang. My build ends up more suited to deal with the second phase, which is appreciated for such a pretty fight.\n\n\n\nAnd the flame is I.\n\n\nThis is it then.\n\n\n\nAnd the world is I.\n\n\nI will become the lord of the frenzied flame!\n\n\n\nAnd the world is flame.\n\n\nI never expected I would end it like this, but after all why not? Melina is on my tracks.\n\n\n\nI know who you are now…\n\n\n\n\nRebirth\nSurely you didn’t think I would stop at this right? I plan to get all the endings, and even find all the unique items. Need to see it all! But this is a story for another time as I have to wait at least a few months before the wiki has updated enough.\n\n\n\nThe victory lap.\n\n\nBack at it again! It was a long while, and time for the big census! Took me more than a day, but managed to file a list with exactly 410 remaining items to find. It was a long journey, but finally the end was reached! I’ll spare the details as it wouldn’t be anything new, and mostly involved some grinding and running the world, but it was a nice closure…\n\n\n\nRestoring the natural order as my final move.\n\n\nNot! To top it off, I decided to start a randomizer run because I heard it was well-made. It ended up being a really fun experience! Took the opportunity to try out a wildly different build: two handed greatsword. No more magic tricks, it’s melee time!\n\n\n\nSummary execution.\n\n\nEverything being changed around kept the gameplay at the center, and it really is the shining glory of the game. I learned to fight many of the bosses that gave me a hard time before. The new build really pushed me to learn the patterns fully and it was quite enjoyable!\n\n\n\nThe final mountain to overcome!\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe first and most important point I would say is that it’s important to keep in mind it isn’t Dark Souls, and while a lot of aspects are similar, it wasn’t designed as such. The open world and scale have a completely different goal, and while you lose the tightknit feel of previous games, the exploration aspect definitely gained. The dungeons keep the contained design, but the outside is a lot more about free roaming and exploring to beautiful vistas.\nDue to the increased scope, there’s obviously going to be asset reuse, and while I don’t mind it too much seeing bosses as enemies later on, I feel like minor dungeons could have used some more hand crafting in the layouts. A few more variants in the room and passage types could have been great.\nAll the tools available and the open worldness of the game are a great way of allowing a modular experience, allowing players to make it as hard to themselves as they want, without making it uncompromising to less experienced players. It still kept the same soul as previous games and won’t pull punches either. The easy mode is already here!\nAlthough all this modularity isn’t perfect either, crafting is underexploited for the importance and frequency ingredients have in the looting. You’ll rarely make anything more than a few basic necessities unless you force your build to use it, not to mention shops cover most of the frequent needs. Maybe it should have been integrated into making weapons and armor and improving your gear, instead of only using smithing stones. Because of this, I wish more pick ups were golden runes, which is the least interesting loot yet still universal. Also, greases became useless due to ashes of war replacing their use as a timeless upgrade you can add. Maybe if there was less overlap, it could be still interesting to use.\nI didn’t mention the story and lore a whole lot, and that’s because it can be very easily ignored, although I personally liked having some things to wonder about. You either care or don’t, it is mostly a vast world that existed before you.\nThe horse is quite good and has a lot of quality of life compared to other games. Even on foot, jumping really changes how you can walk around and explore, that was a huge hindrance in previous games and it even adds to the combat now.\nCombat evolved in a great way overall, player got stronger tools with guard-counter and poise-breaking as substantial mechanics, needing to open up the enemies proactively now since they won’t wait for you anymore. Even with my sorcery build, it was engaging and felt like I was playing the game (even if at some points I took the brainless easy mode).\nI really liked how most story bosses had phases that are triggered halfway through their health, which is a huge step up from the “yet another final form” that used to happen once the health was down. Now it’s clearly telegraphed when the fight is over, barring a few exceptions(the final boss being the most obvious and understandable one).\nSomething that did disappoint me on the other hand, is the terribly lacking new game +. I’ve noticed the trend on the Dark Souls games over time to have less new content on NG+ onwards, especially with the achievements which devolved from “gather most of the unique things” to simply “beat the bosses and reach the different endings”. There’s not even new talismans to find anymore, in Elden Ring the only thing you’ll have to do is do the other endings and whatever you might have missed the first time. The legendary items collection is laughable when you realize there’s less items to get for each than we have fingers.\nAnyway, that was just my personal annoyance, the main strength of the game lies within the gameplay feel and replayability - this is where the randomizer comes into play. The game is so large and diverse that it’s physically impossible to try out everything and experience things properly that way. Having things scrambled unpredictably means you’ll be kept on your toes and forced to try out new strategies on each run.\nI’ve done only one run and am already itching to try a new one(which will likely happen at some point), the combat has become addictive for me… I highly recommend trying out the randomizer after clearing the base game, it duplicates the fun of playing it again!\nSo yes this game is great, and like all the other Fromsoft games, has flaws and clunkiness which are overshadowed by all the good parts.\nEasily one of the best games I’ve ever played.\n\n\n\nDon’t hesitate any longer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: CTMC\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.20.4 - Map = 1.0.1\n\n\nPresentation\nMapwreck 7 - Subterranean is a full length CTM map. It was made under a week with a high amount of participants. Each iteration sees changes to improve the workflow and deliver a better end product.\n\n\nOverview\n\nLand of the Sandman - Orange\n\n\n\nEven going blind, it was obvious who made this one.\n\n\nWhere I really started the map, looking more appealing and pretty fun. The area gets a 10/10 for having the Enter Sandman disc. The two currencies specific to the area burden it, it only has uses for one NPC and takes way too much inventory space. Can’t even use the ender pouch to store it because you need it while doing the area. A great introduction to the map overall.\n\n\nOvergrown Ruins - White\n\n\n\nSkull Emoji.\n\n\nStarting the map with the tutorial is interesting and a nice way to teach some more complex systems not everyone knows that well, big contrast from Mapwreck 6. The contrast is also made with a very flat follow-up, not sure where to go it felt like a field with generated content. The second part of the area had more layout quality and enjoyment.\n\n\nMoonlight Lake - Monument\n\n\n\nTrouble is bubbling up.\n\n\nI’ll always be not a fan of putting the monument and functional parts separate(especially the TP/utilities), even if it’s not too far here. Loving the portable tp, and wow what a great ability to bring back npcs! In terms of aesthetics, the koi and bubbles give a lovely mystical aspect. Monuments are getting fancier with all the custom tech and dynamic monuments, it’s good, but I’m also a grumpy person and I like the action of placing each objective to its definite place instead of autosorting.\n\n\nThe Exclusion Zone - Magenta\n\n\n\nMayday Mayday Mayday!\n\n\nIt ended quite fast, the inside felt a bit messy. Pretty standard, the theme’s identity didn’t feel significant enough. I quickly went to Light Blue.\n\n\nCursed Mines - Light Blue\n\n\n\nLoud sound warning.\n\n\nThe rails made combat AI a bit awkward, aside that it was fun to play with a nice theme. The sensors are positively frightening even if they don’t spawn the warden, truly cursed. It’s not classified as one, but it’s an intersection area for sure.\n\n\nCrystalline Caverns - Yellow\n\n\n\nYou obtained the crystal dash!\n\n\nAnother banger, probably just projection but it reminded me of Veiled Exodus with the calcite and warm colored ground, along the labyrinthic tunnels. The mobs felt abundant and sadly I think it was quite apparent the basic mobs had a lot of armor, making combat awkward with some weapon types. The new mob range also means a huge amount of extra hits compared to before, it’s going to give me ptsd from being mobbed. Found an insanely amazing chestplate that makes my build, full health no armor, go Vitality Plating! (Editor’s note: it was nerfed later)\n\n\nHexacitadecimal - Gray\n\n\n\nThe 6th area I cleared.\n\n\nEven if the initial impression was mitigated by the mechanic having an awkward start (some number ranges chosen for the levitation made it not pleasant to use in the central room), the final room was perfect and made me engage with it again despite stopping earlier - honestly, I don’t want to blame the area too much because levitation is inherently frustrating for the player by taking away control, and it wasn’t done poorly here. Overall a pretty solid area which I enjoyed despite dying twice for the same reason in the same room(I already had over twice normal health at that point). The area has some fantastic unique items as well, my favorites being the Forkinator and Arcane Reaver. The vibe is pretty surreal, although the outside is less interesting to play due to being more of wilderness paths.\n\n\nHellfire Ledges - Blue\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a slice of the pizza.\n\n\nFrom Light Blue, to Gray, to Blue? What’s happening!? The perfect mix of danger and fun combat, the level design is alternating between building and land to keep it varied. Going into extremes also pushes the combat through mirroring the threats - ranged to answer ranged being hard or too dangerous to reach, and melee against mobs that devalue ranged through gap-closing abilities or spawn spam. Not to say other areas didn’t do that, but the distinction has never been as clear as here. A seemingly standard theme (nether fortress and mobs) yet the most fun I had.\n\n\nGarden of Journeys - Brown\n\n\n\nNo endless stairway?\n\n\nI like how thematic the enemies are, the area would be spotless if not for two specific mobs that are offensively unfair. The unkillable charging charged creeper that blasts through walls is just cheap deaths, and the haunting skeletons while less instantly deadly are just too frequent in casting so with the fast spawners and slow despawn of the reapers there’s no space to breathe - that the only seeming reasonable solution to deal with those mobs is despawning or running away (cheap cheese tactics) makes me want to say there’s something very wrong in the designs. I’ve used the reaper ability before and it’s not one suited for swarm mobs. Aside that, I love the trap pots triggering randomly when nearby, the trial paths and overall vibe of the area.\n\n\nBloody Madness - Green\n\n\n\nLe Baron Sang-Vin.\n\n\nAnything blood themed is an instant win for me. At that point I had enough strong unique item that common gear takes a big dip in interest(still using the Vitality Plating and Arcane Reaver), even though I did find some essential parts in the area(mainly more max health armor pieces!). Somehow it felt like the area lacked one extra ranged threat, because almost everything was melee and the witches didn’t deal any damage. Spawner placement was semi obstructed and the coffins were top tier. Surprisingly the first area to have keys. This area is massively based for having locked barrels.\n\n\nNautilopolis - Red\n\n\n\nWe found Atlantis!\n\n\nIt’s a pretty fun area making use of the riptide tridents. The mobs clearly show they’re entering endgame, overall quite good, only a minor annoyance with the laser vindicators who have a tendency to do the smash jump into a big rebound so it’s a pain to kill them before the laser goes off. This is where I really get my final pieces to update my health build. Past that point, even before a bit, I would only be tickled; I reached immortality.\n\n\nCephalopod’s Fury - Black\n\n\n\nYou spin me right round, baby, right round…\n\n\nThe boss itself looks incredible, and overall a fun battle, sadly I was met with technical issues and after getting stuck on the third phase(no idea how to break the shield) and leaving, the boss instantly died when I reentered the arena later. Other than the boss though, it’s hard to call the area more than a fancy boss arena, not bad but not too interesting either. After that I went to the glass desert from the hell path in Brown, and it somehow felt more spammy than the final areas, was not super fun.\n\n\nCrimson Nocturne - Cyan\n\n\n\nLet me out, please!\n\n\nIt’s been a while since I wasn’t a fan of an area’s layout. The vibe is pretty cool, but getting lost in the samey large paths wasn’t. The bonus were weirdly spread and I spent more time than I’d be comfortable saying searching the last one. Looking up shows nice aesthetics, but that’s not enough to offset the rest. The abyss watchers were a fun nod.\n\n\nLereaks Jungle - Purple\n\n\n\nSir, put down this ocarina before somebody gets hurt!\n\n\nWhen I first read that name, I didn’t expect it’d be an ice themed area. The pottery houses were funny and unlike the other areas, the land was more like a snowy plain to reach the buildings without much combat. A nice refresher after the maze hell just before. The fox enemies were a bit strange and didn’t really do anything. The slugcat was a surprising final upgrade to my gear, unexpectedly the best helmet I could have ever wanted. This area is massively based for having locked barrels.\n\n\nDarkblight Grotto - Lime\n\n\n\nGive me all your gold or I’ll mug ya!\n\n\nI walked into the area, fell into a random spider pit, and got the objective??? It mostly feels like wilderness, I’m not a fan, and it wasn’t helped by the cursing spider stealing all my 24h buffs so goodbye the 8 rubies… Unlike those, this was shorter than a basic potion length.\n\n\nWaxing Icarus - Light Gray\n\n\n\nI’ve seen enough anime to know where this is going…\n\n\nThe white and black aesthetics, combined with the tendrils pathing around the building to break the layout’s flow, make for a strong theme. I like how it uses verticality to the maximum, the only area to do that in the map. The sort of spikes mechanic was ok I guess although too rarely relevant, and what sets the area back is the difficulty to see much at times - no colors and black on black paths.\n\n\nSouldrain Reactor - Pink\n\n\n\nEnter the matrix cube.\n\n\nAn interesting one to end the map on (my playthrough, that’s not the final area), the keys ensured I couldn’t steamroll it in 3 minutes since I had to explore around more. It’s pretty thematic and the magnetic core chamber for jump boosting is really fitting.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nHe’s watching you.\n\n\nGear and mob balance was honestly quite great, aside few exceptions there were no jarring spikes or cliffs. Made me use a decent amount of tridents and crossbows. For combat, the new mob range means so many extra hits, I feel like durability is going to become more and more of a legacy liability to get rid of. The tesseract having issues didn’t help. Felt like I was robbed of my flawless run with the 4 (2 from gray’s mechanic, and 2 from the brown immortal creepers) deaths I didn’t feel like I had a say in.\nSpeaking of flawless, the ender pouch is really really nice, it helped reduce some amount of inventory nightmare. Because there were too many currencies(what is this, a gacha game?!), materials, items, would be nice if some weren’t physical or less everything everywhere at once - to give an example, I obtain some lapis and mob essence but I’m tight on space, what do I do? You could say “store it in the ender pouch” but it’s a common material I am guaranteed to find more of right after, increasing the amount of management compared to having 5 slots permanently taken just for those drops. Despite the intent, I was not a fan of the torches, it’s already a pain enough to transport and they run out too fast since you can’t stock them efficiently anymore. Would’ve liked block/log recipes and more from coal blocks. Compared to Patient 0, there was a better mix of chests and d.i.e.s. this time.\nI liked the idea of making bonus objectives have different uses, but it also felt that bonus objectives were devalued by just being able to buy them, making finding each no more than a token checkmark. Speaking of, the bonus box could’ve used the detection of the redstone lamp (pretty smart interaction btw), feels a bit awkward to have the advancement before getting the ruby. So many empty containers that could’ve been locked, but some areas were based so things are evolving.\nThe map lacked more static teleporters despite the amazing portp, because of that I felt pressured into not backtracking and pushing forward instead even if I was going a bit out of order. Some areas were too flat, layout suffering. I don’t usually make area ratings, but I was compelled this time: my most beloved areas were Blue, Green, Yellow. The ones I did not, were Lime, Cyan, White and Magenta(interestingly, those 4 are the ones I couldn’t manage to get a snapshot I liked). As for the rest? It’s all quite great. Honestly this map has an incredible quality even with the flaws.\nWhile the process is still kinda cursed, the end result is becoming more and more enjoyable and a way to see a good variety of every mapmaker’s style. Thanks for hiding the names till the end."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: ZeyD_\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.16.5\n\n\nPresentation\nSaturnine Memories is a medium length CTM map. It is in hub style with all areas available from the monument area.\nThis was done with a beta version, so some things might have changed since.\n\n\nOverview\n\nMonument\n\n\n\nA well defended home.\n\n\nThe start is nice and chill, with no lack of resources although we don’t have access to stone yet. The elite mob just incentivized not fighting it because of corpse crawler and I ended up sending them into holes.\nBigger than usual monument areas, it’s a nice central hub although with some extra walking. I do have to complain about the bonus monument and trader being too far from the base.\n\n\nGreen\n\n\n\nLush and vibrant jungle.\n\n\nThis area has an interesting mix of paths, buildings and temple to explore. But it’s not perfect as it lacks variance in those, after clearing a few buildings you’ll know the rest of them. It could benefit from having more handmade details to differentiate each, the human brain is very susceptible to repetition because it lowers the stimulation due to known patterns. Reaching the temple is refreshing.\nThe layout suffered also from being fairly mirrored, with several paths to the big temple where it obviously leads to the objective. Losing content as not many player will bother exploring it all. The inside of the temple also has some mirroring, but much less.\nThe mobs were all fine except the archers, which were annoying to deal with since they completely negated melee. This early in the map, it would’ve been preferable to have a lesser effect or another type. The golden sword was great.\n\n\nCyan\n\n\n\nNo smurfs living here…\n\n\nHere, the variance was better due to the path, but inversely, I feel like it could’ve had more building gameplay. Better details but lower level variance. Despite how confusing it looks, there is a main path to follow which leads to the objective. I feel sorry for the player if he decides to skip around the road though.\nI appreciate the waterfalls to get back to where we are if we die, it really prevents nightmare scenarios near the end.\nDespite being stronger, the archers felt better to fight because they would die without too much trouble, unlike the previous area. Found the best helmet as well.\n\n\nLight Gray\n\n\n\nLava mine, a staple!\n\n\nMy favorite area, it was fun and the mobs are nice(yes even the vexes!) to fight. It has great items, good mix of tunnels, platforms, mines and dungeon layout. And a strider safari bit, although it sadly isn’t really part of the path, it’s only for extra exploration. The shortcut use was smart although the placement of the crossroad can lead the player to just pillar up since the path leads away from the castle.\nThe only and best eruption pickaxe of the map.\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n\nThe tower of Swine.\n\n\nThis area has the best visuals. The town in the fortress outskirts has fun personalization of the buildings. Although comes back the problem from Green, it lacks variance for the interiors in gameplay. The upper fortress was great and the mean invisible crawling labyrinth was worth the torture!\nCombat was a bit let down for me, with mostly tanky mobs and no effective weapon(except a rare one).\n\n\nRed\n\n\n\nNom nom nom…\n\n\nAnd so comes the final showdown. And if the previous area was the best visually, this one has the best vibe(the heartbeats were great). The hyper cousin of Horrifeye’s last area, which are legally unaffiliated, holds the toughest combat and best gear.\nThe use of keys was appropriate for the layout and was clear enough to avoid ending at a loss. Void was present, but never as an unfair threat.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nVictory!\n\n\nFor starters, everything looks breathtaking. The building style has clear inspirations from Ragecraft and Simulation Protocol and it looks gorgeous. It is clear that artistic direction is the main strength here, but the custom items and mobs weren’t half bad either.\nAlthough this is also where the entropy syndrome appears; due to aesthetics being prioritized, the level layout suffers in gameplay. It consisted mostly in spawners trailing on the path, which while not bad, lacks of unique level design strength. On the other hand, the signs indicating it wasn’t worth going in the decorations were greatly appreciated. Being unsure of the mapmaker’s intentions in terms of loot and secrets is vital to avoid pointless trekking.\nThe custom formatting on the items meant that you weren’t able to see changes when using the anvil, making it hard to track or even not aware of it even working. A sacrifice for looking nice.\nThat one is more of a personal style, the mobs were overall more tanky but with shorter detection range, so it makes sense they have to be tougher to prevent rushing down. I find it less stimulating because you have to approach the spawners to initiate combat, making it a more passive flow. While I have the tendency to make weaker mobs that die faster, but have a much bigger detection range, creating an engaging pressure to deal with. But that’s how tastes work.\nThe conclusion might sound negative overall, but that’s because I pointed out the flaws in priority. Feedback is important to figure out what worked and what didn’t. And with this, I can safely say that it is an impressive second map, and that overscope will be booted far away for the future. Savor it so you don’t burn your tongue."

    "text": "Map Author: CTMC\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.19.2\n\n\nPresentation\nMapwreck 5 - Currents is a full length CTM map. It was made under a week with a high amount of participants.\nThis map was played in multiplayer.\n\n\nOverview\n\nFrosted Factory - White\n\n\n\nI didn’t get it was a sugar themed area until later.\n\n\nIt was a fun little area, not much to say, fairly unusual theme for a first but I didn’t dislike it. The trident was way too broken so early though, going to diamond power level from wooden.\n\n\nPainter’s Paradise - Orange\n\n\n\nThe artist struggle.\n\n\nThe mobs were wacky, I liked how it made you discern which enemies where good for you or not. The tower of doom was cool, although this map as an abusive amount of jump boots in many places, all those poor lava eggs…\n\n\nBlightmuck Bog - Magenta\n\n\n\nWelcome to Oblivion.\n\n\nLooks really sick(in all meanings), although I didn’t really experience it due to getting lost. Seems to have fun uses of hazards.\n\n\nRemote Highlands - Lime\n\n\n\nThe lone pilgrimage.\n\n\nPretty good area, the loot is wacky in balance with some great weapons and other subpar gear. I found the goofy crossbow glitch, very handy for fast travel. I liked the vista of being on the cliffside while progressing. I got lost while entering magenta then going up a lava shaft and ended up doing this area alone.\n\n\nCrystallized Shrine - Monument\n\n\n\nRelocated base of operations.\n\n\nNot a fan of this one, it’s confusing with the pedestals that accept any objective, and the utilities are too spread out and unpractical. The teleporter room is cool but also troublesome to use, always needing to double check which goes to where.\n\n\nHog Roast Hills - Light Blue\n\n\n\nBraised pork with pine scent.\n\n\nIt was alright, kinda meh to be honest, but as we’ll see soon enough, meh is good, I like meh. The spruce spider fang was a big carry, hunter 3 so early is pretty broken.\n\n\nArtic Research Facility - Bonus 1\n\n\n\nLike a fool, I didn’t use leather boots.\n\n\nIt had a interesting use of level design to make it fun to navigate. Although maybe my complaint would be that it didn’t have enough hidden vents and passages, it seemed ripe for it.\n\n\nFrostfire Throne - Yellow\n\n\n\nThe first of the painful areas.\n\n\nIt begins. It was way too chaotic and overwhelming, not very fun, the phantom spam with the nova was epileptic. The bottom part didn’t make it that much better.\n\n\nMagmatic Depths - Bonus 2\n\n\n\nWater buckets need a ban.\n\n\nIt was kinda fun, although we just went in with water bucket surfing above the lava. Grr, the blasting boots break all sense of level design areas made, the return of the moonlight hookshot.\n\n\nThermic Rift - Pink\n\n\n\nHell on earth.\n\n\nIt looks really cool, but the level and mob design was a nightmare - it made me regret yellow’s chaos. The big pit of doom, deadly mobs and corpse runs made it a purgatory, ending it was a relief. Black Devil’s Blade is amazing, thanks Cooley.\n\n\nField of the Fallen - Purple\n\n\n\nNice abstract aesthetics.\n\n\nIf you thought the previous areas were too much, this one amps the mobs to eleven, especially the bow skeletons which deal an absurd amount of damage. It’s painful to say that, but the aesthetics are nice(I always love some pure white buildings) and the rest is lacking; the loot was disappointing with too many chests containing barely a handful of food or arrows, although I did use the evasion 2 iron sword until the end of the map. While we didn’t die as much thanks to the simple layout, it was still not a very pleasant experience.\n\n\nRuins Shangri-la - Blue\n\n\n\nMy favorite with lime, some solid simple CTM gameplay.\n\n\nQuite great, it reminds me of render-style final castle level design. The mobs were a bit on the funni side, but they were quite good in difficulty that doesn’t rely on big numbers. The loot had the right power level of just stronger enough from purple/lime without being too no-brainer upgrading, aside some useless pieces and the super strong offhand locked behind the riddle. What lacked mostly was to have some shortcuts to make navigation easier.\n\n\nNereids Abyss - Green\n\n\n\nUnder the sea.\n\n\nThis is when I began having a headache while playing; I didn’t like the messy palette, layout was very confusing, and the mobs were weird and made a lot of noise constantly. It wasn’t particularly hard though, and the loot was mostly ignored.\n\n\nRuinlight Remembrance - Red\n\n\n\nCrying.\n\n\nI will surprise no one if say that it was too much. It was a sensory overload of custom stuff, with mobs, shaders, items. The unique loot wasn’t too appealing for the situation(I did use the peruvian boots though, they fit my build well) and it felt frustrating to deal with the locked chests(although I’ve heard they were set way too high). The area quality is apparent, I just wasn’t able to enjoy it fully.\n\n\nCliffside Monastery - Bonus 3\n\n\n\nThe last respite.\n\n\nWhat I needed was some simplicity, and that’s what I got here. It was fun and short, a good change of pace from the chaos.\n\n\nThe Mephistophelian - Black\n\n\n\nI don’t find Faust in all this.\n\n\nWhat better end to this chaotic power trip than this? I appreciated that it wasn’t overly difficult, and overall it was a nice area, I just couldn’t see well; the palette made things very dark. At that point my headache grew worse, but at least it was the end.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nI’ll need some rest after all this.\n\n\nThe aesthetics were very solid all around, but the gameplay fluctuated greatly, so I want to give a big up for the participants and the compilers who worked very hard so the map sees release.\nI liked the way it was all connected, giving a more cohesive world feel. Sometimes the teleporters were hard to notice, or in inconvenient places. Due to the linear progression and spread area locations, it was a bit annoying to follow the set order by running around.\nI didn’t understand why the bonus areas weren’t simply normal areas, and the bonus objectives needed a name change so it doesn’t feel like you need to make them. The bonus netherite was better although that’s just emeralds without hints - I’m glad it’s not boring crafting.\nEven though we had graves, it was still inconvenient, had me remember why I made Death Toll. Corpse runs add unnecessary padding before you get to play again, and often leading to inventory nightmare/gold experience requiem.\nI only realized it at the end, but past Blue, I barely looked at loot even though I’m sure there were strictly better gear to find. It was a bit too weird, and we were already so comically overpowered. I’m impressed that the map managed to reach this level of power trip without even reaching diamond tier, I had worse armor than iron.\nWe need better mob testing, and some custom overload budget so it doesn’t feel like entering into a casino. The final chunk of the map was giving me a severe headache with the dark visuals and aggressive stimulations.\nI think that despite the problems, Mapwreck 5 is still an improvement over 4, anticipating the reception of 6!"

    "text": "Modpack Author: davqvist\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.12.2 - Pack = 1.3.0c\n\nIt’s the beginning of a new adventure, and this time we’re going to delve into the Exoria modpack. This pack begins with us being exiled in a barren place full of ash, but not all hope is lost.\nComing out of the banishing portal, we will work on our redemption towards going back home.\n\nThis was an old post that was lost when the previous blog was shut down. By miracle it was salvaged through archives, but all the images were lost. All the quotes were supposed to be under a corresponding screenshot of the game. Enjoy this piece of history!\n\n\nA long and arduous journey is waiting for us…\n\n\nBanished\nA one-way portal, a few tools and ash are our only starting resources. I swiftly explore around to scavenge scattered skeleton remains and gain a few more basic resources. With my starting tools, I can gather enough to trade for some dirt and saplings, and obtain wood. Using a chopping block to gain planks, I then am able to start crafting a few more advanced things.\n\nVery basic storage, making way to processing wood for better uses.\n\nThrough the use of simple survival water filters, I begin to gather a heap of new resources, opening even more my possibilities. With this, I’m able to obtain grass and a slew of different seeds to grow later. Making more crafting stations such as basic furnace and crucible gives me the ability to get buckets and produce water on my own, thus a cobblestone generator is born.\n\nLife always finds a way back in. It is our role to cultivate it.\n\nWith the garden well underway, food is no longer an issue. I make myself some stronger tools, and start exploring to find huts with magical runestones and items. At the same time, I managed to gather enough metals to craft a basic melting crucible and proceed into more complex components and machines.\n\nAll this ash suddenly gained more value as sieving became possible.\n\nI built a life infusion shrine as well as a giant apiary to start cultivating fishes and bees. Meanwhile, I made contraptions using combustion and condensation to produce resources through alchemy. My small home is becoming larger as I dig inside the hill I settled in to make it all fit.\n\nSifting paid off, although I will need a lot more effort to obtain enough diamonds.\n\n\n\nWe Need to Go Deeper\nNow that I did a breakthrough in progression, I am able to make myself much stronger tools, as well as open a portal to the underground of the planet. After some preparations, I set off into the dark and dangerous depths in search of more useful materials.\n\nSetting up the core pump to obtain embers through the bedrock.\n\nMy expedition is fruitful, and I bring back many useful components, allowing me to build a coke oven and start working with embers. This will give me access to alloying metals, and some more convenience machines. I also install an exchange tablet to do alchemical crafting.\n\nAnd from the egg came out all the other animals, thus perpetuating life.\n\nA new portal was created, this one leading into the core, with a lot more resources and monsters. I did not linger much inside, and went back to start a cow farm and continue making new machines. The obtention of redstone will provide me with a lot of options, and I will start producing very basic power by running with rubber boots.\n\nSteel being essential to make advanced machinery.\n\n\n\nInspired Engineering\nI will begin with simple thermopiles and windmills for a low yet consistent power input. With this, I can start focusing on engineering projects and producing advanced components like redstone chipsets using lasers. Using those, I can inscribe circuits with acid and create complex machines that need power to function.\n\nA trophy for the worthy. The cow layer was breached!\n\nWith the aid of the new machines, I am able to build a portal that will lead to a new planet with huge valleys of mist. It feels like a whole new world opened to me, but sadly fast enough it will become apparent that it will not yield many useful resources. Instead I go back in my ashen home and start meddling with miniaturization to create machine frames.\n\nThe power of technology is now mine! My spider sense is tingling.\n\nAll these advancements will allow me to set up a void ore miner tier 1 to start gathering resources even more easily, although power is now becoming an issue. So I start working towards it by making a basic solar panel, as well as automating a bit more my metal production as it’s all very costly.\n\nSearching for oil, it’s time to get some real power going.\n\nThe industrial revolution is upon us! With my newly built pumpjack and distillation tower, I am getting some fuels that I can use to power up a diesel generator which in turn powers back the extraction machines. Power is no longer such an issue and my void miner can run at full power now.\n\nFully charged jetpack, the air is my domain!\n\nThanks to the now consistent oil processing, I can even create a side generator using gasoline and enderium turbines, increasing even more my power output. That will be greatly needed as more and more machine need to be functional. This will allow me to make plastic as well as easier resource production and automated farming.\n\nThrough this, I realized I was hitting a power bottleneck…\n\n\n\nPower of the Stars\nUsing all I had obtained, I was able to create a knightslime portal leading into a moon, my world was finally expanding! In there, I could find strange marble ruins and crashed spaceships, it was time for me to combine both magic and technology to reach higher heights.\n\nFor all purposes when away from home, don’t forget your chunkloader!\n\nUsing the neon crystals found underground, I started making research on space technology. It required the use of a new power type called neon energy, thankfully it could easily be produced with basic means. After researching a whole lot I even figured out a way to directly convert redstone flux into it, making it a resource free power source.\n\nA slightly cramped spaceship, but oops, I can’t produce the fuel yet. Time to switch gears.\n\nMy next step required to begin delving into star power and altar making. I found a good spot and could focus starlight into many useful creations, each night progressing further towards my goals. At the same time, I worked on genetical selection of bees to obtain crystals and upgrade my void miner. Sadly all this effort would be for naught as it would be incredibly inefficient and I would obtain enough of them through the miner when the bees weren’t even started producing anything.\n\nAttuning to the best constellation, I can gain new insights and improve further…\n\nAlthough it made me acknowledge my power issue, that I then permanently solved through a steam turbine with an absurd power output. With this I could permanently power an upgraded void miner, as well as all my machines and a mob factory. Thanks to this side project, I got enough time and was approaching the end of my star and space researches.\n\nWith magnetism no longer a mystery, my spaceship fuel would be soon ready.\n\nI flew away and soon arrived on a new planet called Menelaus. It was an alien landscape and didn’t have much I had a use for, but I found metals into the gravel there which would prove essential. Thanks to those, I built several satellites and a launching station to send them collect data into space.\n\nMeanwhile I had to dig using starlight to obtain hydrogen and oxygen to create rocket fuel.\n\n\n\nThe Long Way Home\nAfter creating a few more costly machines, everything was set, I could finally send the satellites off to space. Through the use of a guidance computer, I could ensure my rocket would come back, but that required me to increase my chipset production. With this I would be able to set off a space station and prepare my travels.\n\nLeaving to space, goodbye my sweet home!\n\nAlthough it very quickly became apparent I couldn’t breathe, so I had to warp home and make a space suit. Once this was resolved, I could focus on researching new planets and warping my space station to their orbit. Each time the new planets would have new landscapes which had artifacts allowing me to find further locations and go to them.\n\nThe End, but not the end of my adventures.\n\nAfter all these endeavors, I found my final goal: my home planet. I was eager to come back to my old home, but what was waiting for me was only ruins. Meteor rains had destroyed everything, not a single soul remained. Devastated, I reached the entrance of the portal room which had been the starting point of my exile.\n\nIn there I found the portal responsible for this, it was a door leading to a void dimension full of dangers.\n\nAfter cultivating and gathering some of these void fruits, I was able to brew a potion that could give me access to the top of this dimension. I found strange houses, and in there were rare materials to summon a strong foe which gave me a star that would open a portal.\n\nThe time of revenge has come to the responsible of all this.\n\nTo reach the final opponent, I had to defeat the ones guarding the room, and it was no easy feat. The first ones asked me questions I couldn’t answer and erased all I had accumulated over this journey. Infuriated, I had to make use of the otherworldly power of the Internet to beat their impossible riddles.\n\nMeanwhile the other one kept erasing my consciousness and I had to resort to godly powers to bypass him.\n\nAfter dealing with all these troubles and erasures, I finally stepped in the final room. Sadly this time I was stuck in a loop where the boss would not allow me to proceed and even resisted godly erasure. I concentrated all my willpower into one flux empowered arrow and shot it right through the heart. After defeating some underlings, the fight was over, I had triumphed from the unfair odds and avenged my people!\n\nNow all alone, but I would be able to rebuild my home anew.\n\n\n\nAn Endless Journey\nIt was quite a grueling exile that led only to more tragedy. The final parts of the journey were really rough, but it made me realize that the journey itself might matter more than to reach its end.\nAnd with this, I write my last words in this journal with hopes that whoever reads it can gain some insight about it! It is time for me to close this chapter of my story and open a new one - orian34\n\nThe sun sets on an exhausted survivor. Yet now free to go anywhere."

    "text": "Map Author: Binsi\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.17.1\n\n\nPresentation\nParadigm is a medium length CTM map. It is linear with custom mechanics and textures.\nThis is also the first map of the maker.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Refusal\n\n\n\nRemember to always flush.\n\n\nThe map starts and already something is apparent… or should I say the opposite; it is extremely dark and only by guessing the path do I begin playing.\nAside that, the first area is quite fun, introducing many elements and the plot. Another point that is very surprising is how long the area is, element that will prove to be consistent throughout the map.\nThe moving door and tram are well done and unexpected.\n\n\nThe Crucible\n\n\n\nFew industrial levels as detailed as that.\n\n\nWhile the first area is linear, this one sends you first to the monument/base while teasing itself. Then you have no choice but to go back there. It’s a nice feat of level design and progression. (base which has somehow a farm field but plants won’t grow anyway…)\nA lot more open but still overall linear through the strider obtention, this is where the map really starts to show its shine through the many dark soulsesque shortcuts and intricate levels.\nThe difficulty through hazards and mobs ramps up but stays at a comfortable balance (if you exclude one broken item that met lava soon enough). The antifire offhand is great design.\n\n\nChrysalis\n\n\n\nLuxurious and vibrant.\n\n\nEnters my favorite area of the map. The map removes all brakes here and you end up in a dizzingly labyrinthic mix of level designs with varied themes. You also need to find 2 parts of a key to reach the wool, topped with a final rush to leave the place chased by a boss.\nAmazing area through and through.\n\n\nThe Descent\n\n\n\nNo warranty in case of fall.\n\n\nMaking good use of the new height limit, the area is extremely vertical in layout. The incremental change as things get corrupted is really cool and made me wish the sound traps were exploited even more in unique designs.\nThe mobs got tougher but the gear keeps up. The final room had me stumped.\n\n\nSchism\n\n\n\nPurtagory.\n\n\nI didn’t know what to expect for the last area after everything I already went through, and it starts off with a nice change from the usual door unlock. It continues with a giant cave opening and probably where the combat loses its edge once you enter the lab.\nThe piglin crossbowers have so much health, they take 2-3 times more hits than the melee ones, and we don’t really get any worthy weapon to deal with them past that point. The bow is the only good option now, not to mention the weakness debuffs.\nThe darkness made it painful to clear the second half of the area, both straining and simply difficult to know where to go.\nThe boss was interesting but sadly it was very hard to avoid the falling attacks, so I kept getting hit and ended up burning through every single golden apple on me to barely win.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nLost the remaining unique helmets.\n\n\nWhere to start with this map? It had amazing areas and level design filled with Dark souls shortcuts everywhere. Each area was very unique with special mechanics and environment to explore through, keeping fresh.\nDue to that though, the overscope is very apparent with gigantic sprawling areas which could each be several areas. The area fatigue is real, despite the gameplay renewing fairly often, too much content for the reasons to do it. Still really impressive that despite this overscope, it was filled quite well.\nSpeaking of that, the attention to detail was clearly there. But somehow it felt a bit too much, making the gameplay taking a toll on the player with the sheer amount of information to keep track of and explore through. Trying to find all the bonus objectives in this haystack of a masterpiece is a nightmare if somehow you miss one. I appreciate the hints on discord but they should have been in the map to begin with, please. (overall some placements could’ve been a bit less random as well)\nThe unlock for the next area to find is great and fun to add reasons for exploring more. Meanwhile the cave tunnels didn’t have much level design and are probably what suffered the most from so many gameplay segments.\nFinally, the 2 main weak points of the map: the loot spread was awkward and the darkness was painful.\nI can feel that there was some inexperience for that(in an otherwise close to perfect globality) because loot was not really distinguishable. With loot chests containing any kind of loot, and even harder to reach ones were often just basic, it made seeking loot less appealing since you’d get it all from what’s on your path. Not counting the cool unique and secret items, I think better gear could have benefitted from extra difficulty to obtain for it to feel rewarding.\nAs for the darkness, the map had an overall very somber color palette and was dimly lit, resulting in a very dark and difficult to see environment. Even though I play moody because it feels like a night vision like otherwise, I felt really punished for that here.\nBut all this are just trifles in the end, this is an amazing work, especially when you think that it’s a first map. It does a lot of fun stuff and ideas I wanted to do, so I’m really excited to see what else can come out in the future. This map is the fusion of Afterfall and Saturnine Memories factored by Ragecraft 3. Outstanding."

    "text": "Map Author: DarthVid, Luisb1202 & ElRichMC\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.16.5 - Map = 1.0.17\n\n\nPresentation\nFinal Paradox is a full length CTM map. It was originally made in spanish, but after some time we were given a translated version for all to enjoy.\n\nThis map contains incredible scenarios, challenging enemies and unique mechanics. It has more than 40 hours of gameplay that you can enjoy alone or with friends.\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nGlacial Fort - White\n\n\n\nVery imposing for a first.\n\n\nIt was a bit of a rough start with the natural spawns and weak gear. The second part where more gets introduced was solid, it’s nice to have a white wool actually be a snow area for once.\n\n\nSanctuary of Time - Monument\n\n\n\nMy legs ache in advance.\n\n\nMy biggest fear when I entered the monument ended up confirming itself later - it was too large, all of the utility being spread out so there was a lot of running. The elytra given to make it better was sadly too impractical most of the time. Also unsure how useful it is to have to keep the objectives as items since you don’t need to place them until near the end and you still get a bonus from picking them up, might as well just be collected by the helper.\nOn the other hand, it looks really impressive, and some of the utilities introduced are fantastic like the stygian forge or smuggler/skills.\n\n\nSerious Buzzyness - Orange\n\n\n\nA beeautiful place.\n\n\nThere had incredible items to be found, the imp is sooo good, I can’t use any other offhand now that I got it. Thankfully I had the bane 3 hoe and would 1 tap all the bees and silverfish. Because of the mending, maybe they were too strong(along with the smite 3 sword) for having those this early, the nemesis enchants are too strong with spamclick.\n\n\nDragon Cult - Purple\n\n\n\nSakura mushrooms?\n\n\nThe statue mechanic was cool as the first unique one of the map, although a bit annoying to type each word letter by letter. This is where I really started making use of the tome of conqueror and went full on ranged build with the cap.\n\n\nOuroboros Tower - Magenta\n\n\n\nA good place to use the hookshot.\n\n\nI was quite pleasantly surprised by the unique mobs, the endstone mechanic was kinda annoying and confusing when it happened. The first half wasn’t great.\n\n\nMagneto-Gravity Wells - Light Blue\n\n\n\nA place of suffering and death.\n\n\nLight Blue is a collection of horribly cursed mob designs, especially the tnt phantom in open spaces(did you know they have a tendency to fly above your head?). I had the foresight to have a suitable build so avoiding most trouble with my strong ranged power. The gravity mechanic is fine, a bit jittery, sadly not used enough in interesting ways.\n\n\nNuclear Lab - Yellow\n\n\n\nBalling light.\n\n\nTricky spawners used in interesting ways, and a really cool boss that made it worth using items. It was a great area all around, as well as making better use of the tnt phantoms with the level design.\n\n\nÜber RPSP - Lime\n\n\n\nA fortress of doom.\n\n\nOnce again with the cool special enemies, this time embracing level design even more. The nats were very numerous but it was more manageable with stronger gear. Too easy to miss the objective box. Having an attack on the monument was really nice, something rarely (if ever) done in maps yet so interesting.\n\n\nApiglo’s Palace - Pink\n\n\n\nPraise the oink.\n\n\nAn interesting take on area mechanics, although it’s a bit annoying to deal with the janky mob follow AI. Thankfully the area is fairly easy and reaching the boss removes the trouble (and ranged build rocks). Funny boss, although I was baited into thinking I could spare him.\n\n\nHorror’s Zenith - Gray\n\n\n\nit’s death o’clock.\n\n\nCool puzzle area with fairly basic combat. Wasn’t entirely sure how it worked at first, but I managed in the end, you could make a stand out of this. Kinda disappointed that breaking over 12h was hinted at but not actually doable(it loops back). New imp is amazing!\n\n\nLast Magma Foundry - Light Gray\n\n\n\nWhere hopes and dreams are shattered.\n\n\nThis area is chaos, the vents mechanic sucked majorly, with not enough spots to refill so you’d always asphyxiate if you didn’t perfectly evade the smoke. The forge puzzle was interesting although a bit too obscure, I needed the hint.\n\n\nSerpent Corpse - Cyan\n\n\n\nDied of ligma, this is so sad.\n\n\nThis is the inescapable murky jungle area with loads of nat spawns. I found the mechanic more interesting and less restricting than the vents. Overall pretty fun, as well as the boss, never expected I’d play volleyball in minecraft one day. Inventory management does suffer here, more maps should edit drops.\n\n\nCosmic Town - Brown\n\n\n\nNot so peaceful.\n\n\nThe perfect change of pace compared to the intense cyan. Simple paths and combat, with periodical trouble. A new stronger imp is there too! The meteor shower wasn’t super interesting because it’s just stopping the gameplay for a while.\n\n\nNot Heavenly Skies - Blue\n\n\n\nThunder was stolen.\n\n\nA fun playground to use all the various ranged weapons like the scythe, gun, pickarang, thunderbow, bastion spellbook. The puzzle is also enjoyable.\n\n\nWorkshop Of The Makers - Green\n\n\n\nIt’s mech time!\n\n\nAlso very enjoyable, with swarms of zombies all the time, perfect to use aoe weapons. The enhanced turrets are a good design twist and the boss once again manages to change the paradigm in a fun manner. At that point, clearing out paths isn’t that worth and it’s simpler to jump around.\n\n\nThe Immortal Bastion - Red\n\n\n\nCertainly a red area.\n\n\nIt had a rough start with absolute chaos and mob spam, not the best way to introduce the mechanic. Thankfully I could adapt fairly well after that, mostly running in the outside parts to fight at a more reasonable pace once the spawners are a bit more delayed. At that point the best items are available, so the gear is complete. The boss was suited for me, although the intermission phase was frustrating to see where it was safe, managed after some failures.\n\n\nParadox Citadel - Black\n\n\n\nAfter the bombardment.\n\n\nThe mobs were so tanky(might I suggest removing armor values to have only health), it was more interesting to run around and only fight when needed. Inventory always cluttered from random stuff exploding, although at that point there was no loot worth thinking about. The finale was amazing.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nBow wins against sword.\n\n\nThe level design has entropy syndrome with a lot of the standard gameplay being spawner roads and not enough long range spawners, also having a fair chunk of dead spaces(no content). It counteracts that by having quite impressive custom mechanics, items, and enemies. The forging mechanic especially was fun and gave reasons to explore since each item felt worth using.\nThe loot balance was all over the place, with most of the gear being often obsolete due to either forging or a previous area. Finding early enchanted books but no anvil for a while, I think those were the most useless part of the loot for the whole map to be honest. Maybe due to forging, it would’ve been worth focusing more on basic supplies(instead of finding unenchanted netherite hoes in black). The infinite caves were good to avoid annoying grind though.\nFor the aesthetics, I have no complaints, with only two areas that were really unpleasant in gameplay at times (light blue and light gray). The story was fairly cookie cutter, but it was good enough to fill the adventure and give an extra something for each area.\nI didn’t have the will to note every typo or missing translation, but maybe some extra QA could help - there weren’t that many, but still enough to be noted, although I’m thankful having it be translated at all. The mechanical prowess of this map really blew me away, some of these things I couldn’t even dream being possible in minecraft, and yet.\nIt’s rare to have big maps with production value like that, so each should be savored. Highly worth playing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Authors: Gizmo & Cango\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.17.1\n\n\nPresentation\nAfterfall is a short-medium CTM map. It is an open world with custom mechanics and textures.\nThis was done with a beta version, so some things might have changed since.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nA pleasant stroll as mise en bouche.\n\n\nThe start of the map is a good introduction to the different mechanics in a curated space, along with scenarized goal. The crowbar promising many crawlspaces and there’s even puzzle code doors!\n\n\n\nThe closest we’ll get to a central hub.\n\n\nThen, entering the shop alley felt like entering a warzone, a lot more intense but the central point with beds is great for respite. The variety in shop interiors is enjoyable.\n\n\n\nThere is no right path here.\n\n\nThe open world aspect means I could explore at my leisure. The gardens were a challenge due to the very unusual layout with no real path, but it was great fun even with my meager gear and the reward was worth the trouble.\n\n\n\nBreaking through.\n\n\nI cleared the rest of the shop alley, leading to sewers. This definitely felt like a “first objective” area, but not so much after all, the open world aspect is well balanced and means that trying out different places won’t feel uneven.\n\n\n\nBiomess.\n\n\nThat is, excepting the phytohell area, which is a noticeable spike in difficulty and intensity - it can be considered the final area. It felt a bit rough, with paths too similar and no big variance in gameplay. But that’s also coherent with the intentions of the place to be difficult to navigate and it doesn’t prevent it to be perfectly playable. On a more personal note, supposing there would be a question of reworking one aspect of the map, I would say that it should be this one.\n\n\n\nInside the iron guts.\n\n\nFinally, the last location, reached from the end of the previous area(it also has a closer entrance from the shop alley). It is quite labyrinthic, but there are many varied rooms and layouts, keeping it fresh throughout. The tracks for this place are especially freaky.\nThe end bit was nice, without being overkill like some maps like to do for their final final area, just a bit of flavor, fun and combat.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nI did it! …Wait, that’s the wrong map!\n\n\nFirst, since this was made in beta, the small things to fix and such won’t be mentioned since they were already noted and likely won’t appear in the release.\nTo begin with, the vibe of the map is top notch. You can feel the dread and decay of the place, but not in an unpleasant way. It’s very post apocalyptic, maybe it went past me but I didn’t feel much of the horror aspects mentioned. Although the sound direction is poggers, Enshano rocks, keep it up.\nThe open world aspect is really well done, with every area reachable from diverse paths, only the exception of the gardens. The many resources and items scattered everywhere, combined with the loads of secret paths and corners, really push my buttons in terms of fun exploration.\nI do like the possibility of a different ending if you followed the bonus objectives questline, even if it’s just a few different lines of text. The fact the main objectives end up not needed is a bit anticlimactic, the monument aspect of CTMs is not to be underestimated - the gameplay impact is real. You swap the objective chests for levers to flick, and nothing changes on the technical side, watch out for that devaluation.\nThe mobs were themed diverse in each area, but mostly following the same roles. It can be boiled down to zombie and skeleton melee, creeper, spider, and skeleton archer. With the occasional vindicator, blaze, and silverfish in vents. On the other hand, the elites were all quite unique with abilities. Meaning it mostly relied on the vibe and layouts to spice up combat.\nThe decoration was a bit too busy at times, with lots of inventory flooding from the many loot, resources and random junk dropped. The use of the texturepack is very well done and helps greatly sell the ambiance of a different place. The guns were essentially reskinned bows and crossbows, but it works for the general vibe and respective enchants.\nGear and material progression was a bit strange, with a majority of the resources found not being that useful since you will always be able to find a good weapon or armor piece. Stone and gold in particular, where I didn’t even bother using a single piece despite being scarce. I slightly used leather at the very start, then made iron armor at the end since it had superior numerical value to what I could find. The rest was for repairing the good items I looted through. Repair station is great btw, it makes more materials worth gathering. Although more personally, I prefer not being able to sustain the best items too easily.\nI can’t pronounce myself on the flashbangs much, my fault, didn’t use them enough but they were a good offhand option while staying relevant in action. The coded doors were quite enjoyable and a great encas to guard rare loot and bonus objectives. The vending machines did not provide any meaningful use, all that they gave was already plentiful through looting, so unless you’d manage to burn up resources to a crazy degree, it’s hard to want to use them. Although the food items giving out various buffs were real nice, exploiting what is too often left to the side even though it’s a big gameplay component.\nSo globally, the map was amazing, trying out many new things despite being a first time collaboration and it pays off even with some rough edges here and there. Surely it helps that both Gizmo and Cango have the same direction in mapmaking, which I also tend for and particularly appreciate.\n20/20 Would go on a fatal errand again."

    "text": "Modpack Author: fungidelight\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.15.2 - Pack = 1.12.4\n\n\nPresentation\nNatural History Museum is a collectathon modpack that will have you scour the world of all the different samples to display.\nIt’s fairly short and easy, mostly to fill your collecting compulsions.\n\n\nOverview\n\nSetting Up the Foundations\nI started in a forest, so I decide to name the world Leaf Town. There’s a lot to prepare for the museum to be ready. It begins humbly, I have to learn how to make tools similarly to tinkers but using blueprints directly.\n\n\n\nNo crossing animals here.\n\n\nI set up a base camp and mine a bit to finish the first quest. To my surprise, there are gigantic lava lake caves under my spot, this makes it easier to find the rarer ores. There are interesting spawners everywhere in the deep caves that summon a wave of enemies to defeat, using the spoils I decide to start the trees display branch, but ultimately find out I will need a lot more badges first.\n\n\n\nToo busy to sleep.\n\n\nSome improvements in my camp for production allow me to begin setting the foundations for the museum, and waiting for the stone to cook I finally find enough diamonds to upgrade my mining strength! Things will get serious now that I can get obsidian to make a transmutation table. But first is a trip to the nether for glowstone, then everything is in place for the great alchemy! I burn every item with EMC then upgrade my tools with the best materials.\n\n\n\nTerraforming to accommodate the future.\n\n\nI relocate some necessities in the entrance staff-only area and alter my tablet to be portable. Things are moving now, quite literally! Progress is made easier and I gain access to a handful of useful tools, along with enchanting to boost my gear. Now that my tools self repair for free, I continue the terraforming and begin completing the live trees exhibits. This leads to my very first expedition to gather samples and a good way to map out the terrain around the museum.\n\n\n\nCrescendo.\n\n\n\n\nThe First Seed\nReaching a dead lock for the remaining unlocked displays, I have no option but to continue the set up questline. Using the power of flight, it’s quite simple to raid the nether of all the needed resources. I don’t even have to bother with mob farming thanks to the farm blocks!\n\n\n\nThis pleases me.\n\n\nWhile this is running, I prepare a set of supremium armor and tools, waiting only on some extra enchantments before using them. I realize I can simply grow a giant pine tree to get the long needed podzol, and this sets off the peat generation for power! It’s mostly to make some crystals, but this is a good step nonetheless. I also try out the premade museum schematic, but realize I prefer keeping on doing my open air park(I wish we had wands though).\n\n\n\nSnowy weather.\n\n\nAs things progress, there are more and more things getting stuck at reaching the End part, so I clear up the rest first. It is time for another gigantic expedition, gathering all the needed blossom saplings and some more things. Doing this paid back enough badges so I can open a new line in the quests! I had most of the other trees so I clear all the rows in a flash, with only a few harder to find(notably the maple tree which I ended up finding more easily in the giant taiga). All the trees done, it’s time to branch off to flowers and plants!\n\n\n\nNatural Exhibits.\n\n\nA very long time later, many hours exploring and I can say with certainty candleberries don’t drop, damnit. I hate having to do it, but to exceptional situation, exceptional measures - it didn’t even have an EMC value so it was strictly impossible to obtain. A quick magic trick and we can finish the gigantic list of crops.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate completion list.\n\n\n\n\nIt Belongs in a Museum\nThe natural direction to go in now is the mystical agriculture crops, as they can bring new resources along. It requires me to make use of my different capturing and spawner tools to fill enough soul jars for the mob seeds, and even some unique adventures like capturing cartographers to find a temple or housing bees. Due to a handful requiring going to the end, I lack enough badges to unlock another row, so I set up additional displays for future sections and to access the last seeds.\n\n\n\nStaff only, do not trespass.\n\n\nAn outlier seed makes me touch a bit of Create to mix brass, then it’s wither time! I do it in the plains to grab some wither roses too, and crush him with my sword, getting the star will be a huge jump in progression. I switch to a full insanium set and add the augments to get night vision, integrated flight and more! Staying in that vein, I fill most of the armor stands with what I can, then decide to take the plunge into the end portal… The fight is somehow really awkward, the dragon sending me away during his roost move. After a drawn out patience game, he is defeated and I can claim all the rewards, as well as begin the final upgrades.\n\n\n\nSkyfall…\n\n\nI finish some loose ends like using fishing traps for the full neptunium set or finding the last missing gem, then I go back for a second round with a bow. After a long flight to find a city, I get all the materials needed from the End; reaching the final steps of the basic setup quests. Using lilypads of fertility, I can have a boosted farm for the gem seed and gain a passive EMC income. While it is running, I fill up the minerals section and finish up the remaining tabs; only the mobs left!\n\n\n\n50 shades of gem.\n\n\nThe final stage is upon us. After some consideration, I decide to display the items on pedestals instead of making a zoo, it’s more reasonable. Making the various eggs is mostly menial at this point, with all the mystical crops yielding what I need, only exception being the wisps which are an absolute pain to spawn. While waiting for chaos to happen, I start on the other branch and find most fishes from rivers and oceans. At this point, there’s not much else to do besides waiting for the last wisps and the special biome fishes which are a huge pain to spawn. Once this is done, the grand opening is ready to go!\n\n\n\nDon’t go drowning while dozing off.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt was an interesting concept, but I feel like it lacked a little something to spice things. The mods added were too much variety without variation; aside being filler I didn’t feel like they were really bringing something. (In way, isn’t this exposing something for a few of those mods?) It would’ve been cool to have a more unique generation and ways to obtain the large variety, but that’d mean a ton of work for the pack.\nIt’s a bit paradoxical but I felt that there was too much dumped at once? Or that it would’ve been better with the collecting quests unlocked by default and having a more extensive progression quest for setting up the museum(PS: I don’t like the ultimate book, it defeats the fun even for an easy pack). It likely wasn’t helped by the laggy quest book that made for a clunky experience.\nAnyway, it’s still great if you like to scratch that hoarding itch. Hopefully there’ll be renovations to make it even more pleasant later. Now I have to go because I can hear the first visitors!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "text": "Map Authors: Ty and Kunii\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.18.2\n\n\nPresentation\nProject 2M is a full length CTM map. It is hard and open world.\nI’m very squeamish about playing hard maps, since I’m not a fan usually, but I heard enough praise that I decided to try it myself.\n\n\nOverview\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nStarting into the eye of the storm.\n\n\nThe start is harsh. Better not fall into the void with the starting wood or you can reset. The campfire is confusing with no explanations, but it becomes fairly obvious once you reach another one. The struggle with wooden gear is real, but aside archers, it’s all manageable.\nNot a fan of having tanky ranged skeletons this early. Natural spawns are always a nuisance, but it’s especially bad here.\n\n\nOrange\n\n\n\nIt has ups and downs.\n\n\nMean traps and daunting combat, but wood and cool are plentiful here and there’s even a good amount of stone. Ups and downs on the ledge is a bit stressful, but it’s rewarding a whole new gear tier. The giant cavern is looking like a big intersection, and finding the second objective this soon is a relief. That means areas aren’t super massive and are finely segmented even in the same space.\nSince you emerge low of resources, there’s a big chance you’ll tackle this area second as you go mine to suit up for the danger ahead. Smart placement.\n\n\nMagenta\n\n\n\nOne of the most fun areas.\n\n\nReally tense and dangerous, felt like walking the tightrope. The kind of areas only hard maps would make, it was refreshing and great.\nNot as deadly as it looks to be… as long as you don’t let a creeper blow up a tnt stack.\n\n\nGray\n\n\n\nI heard it was supposed to be much harder as well…\n\n\nAfter this point, that’s where people will likely spread out in the progression, as you get a whopping 7 possible areas to go to. I chose to go to the mineshaft area since it was closest and seemed to contain good resources.\nThe start is filled with trigger happy wipe traps but thankfully calms down later. The mobs on the other hand are very unassuming but easily kill you in 2-3 hits with full chain armor. I thought they were overtuned until I got the objective, which made sense since it’s what would be considered the halfway point of the map. Lovely suspended bridges area.\nThe iron nugget ore is very smart and a good way of having armor progression feel more natural(even though I completely skipped leather and gold I guess).\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n\nI wonder why I bothered going through the floors instead of skipping down.\n\n\nAfter the previous mistake, I tried tackling the easiest looking area, and it wasn’t too far off the mark. I’m not surprised it wasn’t light blue, considering how yellow everything looked.\nIt was fun and balanced overall, the complaint would be that there was so much damn natural spawns, it burned all my gear and resources.\nA good experience of why I don’t like natural spawns and how annoying they can be. It didn’t help that the whole top of the temple is a waste of time with so much fighting for a stick.\n\n\nLight Blue\n\n\n\nThe vegetation gives me ptsd…\n\n\nWhile the color is similar, it’s not very intuitive to have an early area with nether blocks as it’s usually ominous.\nThis place is basically an exacerbation of yellow’s natural spawn issues due to the terrible vegetation. If clogging your inventory and annoyingly disrupting combat was a boss, this would be it. The fun parts at the end got doused after triggering an unfair wipe trap.\n\n\nPink\n\n\n\nI don’t feel so good…\n\n\nThe looks of a final area, complete with a midway checkpoint, but it’s actually just the 7th area. Probably the best area so far, with magenta being close. It’s fun and dangerous, with lots of ranged enemies, but nothing really mean.\nSome pretty good items in the few chests to loot. The layout made natural spawns more reasonable and likely helped in making it the best experience. Oh, and the heart coral blocks slowly decaying really help sell the “killing the beast” feel.\n\n\nLime\n\n\n\nI expected this to be the midway point area of the map.\n\n\nPretty fun, clean castle conquest area. The illusioner spawners were a bit overkill, when 4 spawned at once I just left.\n\n\nLight Gray\n\n\n\nNot as painful as you’d think, but also not as fun.\n\n\nLike a redo of Magenta, but much more dangerous with sand traps instead of tnt. The many additions of ranged mobs makes it less pleasant, and a single mistake leads to getting wiped. It was fine, but after 5 wipes I wanted to be done with it sooner than later.\n\n\nCyan\n\n\n\nThe place where tragedy struck.\n\n\nThe natural spawns became so much I almost gave up and quit, but instead decided to do the latter half of the map with them disabled. Now keep in mind any area done next will be considerably easier than intended.\nThis made me remember what swarmming was(swimming in mob swarms). The last map that had it was Dark Realms: Odyssey also by Kunii… coincidence? I think not.\nPoison water and suspended bridges are unironically fun.\n\n\nBrown\n\n\n\nCould’ve been great if not for the wool segment.\n\n\nReally unique and interesting. Would’ve been a great area if the hardest segment wasn’t after obtaining the wool. You only have 3 tries and after that, guess the map’s over. (I know about homeward bones, but you can’t expect the player to not spend their limited resources to progress)\n\n\nPurple\n\n\n\nYour princess is in another castle.\n\n\nThat one is incredibly massive. The river ruins segment is fine, although the knockback zombies feel way overtuned since getting sent in the water is not only a death sentence, but also painful to gather the items back. You’ll be forced to look at your items despawn in front of you.\nThe water swim unlock felt straight out of a Metroidvania, and that’s probably what I love most so far. The castle section was quite fun, reminds me it’s possible to enjoy playing, I don’t regret removing nat spawns.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\n\nStunning room.\n\n\nIt was fun, confusing in a good way, and refreshing. You just need to be smart and stay on the teleporters to dodge ambushes.\nAlso, fire, hue hue.\n\n\nRed\n\n\n\nNo will to break…\n\n\nAlright, I found my favorite area of the map. It’s difficult, but not because of power creep, and that’s good design. Feeling the dread while exploring is scary, while also never going overboard to unfairly threaten the player.\nThe feelings of being lost while stumbling in the dark was game changing in a fun way.\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n\nPain.\n\n\nA bit disappointing after red, but I guess that’s what you should expect from a final area in a hard “oldschool” map. Lots of hard combat with bedrock, cobwebs and lava, it becomes numbing after a while. I don’t even want to imagine the purgatory that is doing it with natural spawns.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nNo celebration for me, but I’m glad it’s over.\n\n\nGlobally, the natural spawns are the main annoyance, due to low visibility and lots of space to light up they are incredibly obnoxious. They’re too disruptive to be enjoyable, I’ll largely prefer Horrifeye spawns for a hard type map.\nThere is the right amount of forgiveness in resource renewal… if you don’t count the many wipe traps. You have to learn to manage your resources to go far here.\nThe open world aspect is top notch, with lots of options available and only surviving to guide you. On the other hand, weapons don’t really progress much, you’ll spend a majority of the map with unenchanted stone swords with only near the end getting to iron. Gets a bit weary after a while.\nThe way the mobs and combat are tuned heavily push you into using swords, especially near the end game, due to mob spam forcing fast strikes and higher durability. Bit annoying to not have a real choice.\nThe map had larger spaces than usual with nothing more of interest, which is likely due to being designed around natural spawns. I guess that’s normal, but at the same time, the design suffers from it. This map just confirmed even more why I disliked natural spawns…\nThe bonfires and homeward bones are a really fun way to have checkpoints, flavor is on point too.\nI couldn’t find green, and brown was burned(I looked back and the exit after the wool is basically impossible to go through, what a poor and cruel joke), and since I disabled natural spawns halfway through, I probably don’t deserve to say I beat the map. But I don’t care about that.\nIt is a hard and mean map, but as long as you like suffering(or remove nat spawns), then you’ll find a nice experience here. I can’t recommend it otherwise."

    "text": "Modpack Author: FTB\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.18.2 - Pack = 1.6.1\n\n\nPresentation\nStoneBlock 3 is more of a kitchen sink pack that has you underground for the whole time.\nUnsure what else to expect, let’s just dive in!\n\n\nOverview\n\nCave Out\nAfter the skies, it only makes sense that I would be going deep into the earth. As always I pick the simplest start, one torch and an empty room surrounded by stone; welcome to Stratel. Progress comes quickly after making and using the hammer to pulverize stone until dirt. Then the crook provides me with all sorts of seeds and saplings; life has found its way.\n\n\n\nEden of stone.\n\n\nMy tools still being quite limited, I expand only lightly, and set up a manual mill and a very simple smelter to make a tinker’s iron pickaxe. With that handful of resources, I feel more comfortable progressing, but my production means are still non existent so my next focus is having some chickens.\n\n\n\nMurderous impulse.\n\n\nI will need to really dabble in Create for crafting the resource chickens, that becomes my new priority along with a bigger smeltery. It begins with the fan… a gust of victory is blowing over my windmill. My one hemp seed allows a slow but steady production of string to continue increasing the power my mill can produce. Washing tremendously opens the amount of materials I can use, but I mostly use the copper to finish my smeltery and produce a handful of alloys to finely craft a set of powerful tools.\n\n\n\nUnexpected visitors.\n\n\nIt takes me a while, but with this new power I can finally dig out using a tinker’s hammer, making expanding less straining. Meanwhile, my windmill grows stronger and I append extra utilities to benefit from it. Mixing the mob soul with sand, I can then use the soul sand with a fan to gain more of it, this also gives out the remaining resources needed for the mechanical crafter; a huge step done!\n\n\n\nGuillotine.\n\n\n\n\nA Rooster of Problems\nThe chicken recipes available, I start setting up a rooster farm and breed some of the more valuable ones. Now it’s a matter of juggling the production aspect and starting to build the refined storage to handle all those resources.\n\n\n\nChimken.\n\n\nIt goes smoothly and with most of the resource chickens active, I can easily get enough wool for a new fully upgraded windmill dedicated to power my storage system. The processor “assembly line” set up provides enough to have the system fully operational and I can begin linking the chickens and other production means to it!\n\n\n\nCentralized production.\n\n\nThe semi automatic crafting era arrives, although the RF conversion on the windmill is poor and is barely enough for a handful of crafters and importers; I’ll need to look at the flux network and better generation means to expand more. But first is time for adventure!\n\n\n\nOne wind to bear the mill.\n\n\nI have netherite and feel confident in handling danger, exploration is on the menu tonight! A very long journey is on the horizon, as the distance and digging required make it harder to reach dungeons. I first get a mise en bouche of what’s to come; many mobs clustering in honeypots. I progress more and find a larger dungeon to raid, before proceeding further I go back using the very handy portable teleporter I got as reward.\n\n\n\nGoing out on a walk.\n\n\n\n\nThermic Shock\nI need to uncluster my power generation, and for that, getting a flux network is essential. Thankfully it is quite cheap and allows me to have a lattice setup to add more crafters without fearing a system shut down.\n\n\n\nIs this waterproof?\n\n\nThis expansion spike is a good opportunity to get wireless charging, then I go back and reach the Nether dungeon; also a spike but in difficulty. The handful of wither skeleton heads allow me to obtain my first nether star, immediately used for a philosopher’s stone; desperately needing a ring to obtain ice.\n\n\n\nFaraway lands.\n\n\nWith blue ice, I can optimize the power generation from each thermopile and increase even more the permanent supply; things are getting comfortable. Being in possession of the stone, transmutation isn’t that far away anymore, so investing in powah might be the best move now.\n\n\n\nI summon thee, Jupithermos!\n\n\nHaving a steady but not that high supply of power, I decide to handle it by having a buffer of 128 million, so doing crafts won’t be an energy lockdown. Once that’s done, I can focus on upgrading the setup to reach the first EMC condenser and spend my accumulated emerald blocks.\n\n\n\nAll this power… is now mine!\n\n\n\n\nUnlimited EMC Works\nAfter making it, I optimize slightly my lattice and add 6 extra power storages through EMC. This completely changes the paradigm, now that I can easily duplicate most resources the crafting strain is much lighter. I can remove a good amount of my existing productions while focusing on emerald blocks instead.\n\n\n\nLosing my heads over this…\n\n\nSince I’m at that point, why not simply start looking into neutronium? And it’s fairly cheap, thankfully, so I can prepare a whole matrix superboosted with watches; the endgame won’t be so slow this time. The neutronium production is so efficient, I decide to go a step further and make the compressor too, the final crafting process!\n\n\n\nSilicon cavern.\n\n\nNow that I reached the endgame stage so early, my goals will be to tackle automation of the singularities needed; some maths leave me with 1536 each. My first one is the experience jelly one, which is the perfect opportunity to have a working mob slaughter farm, as well as having access to custom spawning.\n\n\n\nEndangered park.\n\n\nWhile it is running in the background, I can focus on another singularity; randomly choosing, I go for pig iron. I prepare everything for it, install an infinite supply of lava, use the condenser MK2 for zombie heads linked to the reconverted smeltery for mass blood production. I then create a line of max speed induction smelters, powered by my lattice that got superboosted by another watch, tenfolding my energy supply.\n\n\n\nAll your blood are belong to us.\n\n\n\n\nSingular Focus\nIt’s running smoothly, so I look into a third singularity to make; balloons. This one is a whole lot more complicated to do, I have to make a field of botany pots for hemp, as well as pyrolizers and spouts for the treated wood.\n\n\n\nStop spouting this s-!\n\n\nThe pig iron singularities got finished meanwhile, so I look into a new one, uraninite, and increase my powah setup, leading to the nitro crystal one. Needing 20 million for each craft, I’ll definitely need to have increased energy, so I expand a bit more my lattice and bulk up my storage.\n\n\n\nSomehow I couldn’t make it look clean.\n\n\nThings progress on their own, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a bigger advantage, so I make a circuit to easily have watches and boost everything I need. I also clear up the rest in powah and make a super energy unit that can store up to 12B FE, as well as the powah equivalent to my thermopiles, slinging my power supply to almost 1M FE/t!\n\n\n\nOnly 4 of those are enough, why bother with reactors when you have this…\n\n\nI think this is likely going to be my final setup, so I’m able to dabble more into other singularities while the automation progresses on its own. There’s still big slumps like the polonium singularity from mekanism that requires a heavy investment(I dislike mekanism), but otherwise it’s quite smooth sailing.\n\n\n\nIt was harder than expected to understand how to make it work, but it’s perfect now.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Bloody Magic!\nI figure out I can use a personal EMC link to make it even simpler, and got most things looping on their own. Only a handful remain, including all three magic mods; it’s time to have some simpler fun. Botania is always the same, a handful of endoflames and I can leave it running until the end(what a wasted potential that mod is). Blood magic on the other hand, I never really went past the sacrificial dagger, but I can’t afford to do it manually here.\n\n\n\nSimple redstone can do all the job for you.\n\n\nAfter some learning effort, I figure out the best way to tackle it; repurpose my now useless mob farm with a ritual that drains the mobs. I can then place watch pedestals for each blood altar(boosted with runes too) and see the slates fly by! At least the first tier… I need to explore more so I can obtain the ore to upgrade to maximum altar level for efficiency.\n\n\n\nI’ve made a terrible mistake.\n\n\nWhile waiting to complete it, I look into the ars nouveau one and it’s so easy I barely have anything to setup. Not long after that I finalize the altars for a decent speed to craft all the slates without my input. Next… what’s next? All the singularities are done or on the way, I have to get a deeper understanding of create to have the mechanical crafter running at max speed.\n\n\n\nMom, I’m swear I’m the good guy!\n\n\nOnce it’s all handled, the big recipes can be done on their own while I look into all the foods I can’t EMC, thankfully a lot more simple and fun compared to singularities. The next step is… well there’s almost nothing else left is it? The boss is waiting for me far away!\n\n\n\nEffort paying off is rewarding.\n\n\nI prepared by making a bane 5 sword and the fight was quite easy after all. It took me some time to figure out how to make the drygmy farm, then all the remaining hearts were obtained effortlessly! The final items accessible after all this work, I have some fun clearing out the quest tabs while waiting for the autocraft of the infinity catalysts and ingots.\n\n\n\nAn interesting challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf I’m really being honest, I was disappointed. The progress was way too open and quick, reaching chickens and EMC really easily making everything else a side note. I didn’t realize this was a kitchen sink pack.\nMost of the time spent in the pack is for making the singularities. Not enough gated progression before that point to allow some resource backlog that would make the grind less time consuming. I really wish this parody mod wasn’t the standard endgame of almost every modpack. You could chop it down to a 1/4 and not lose much aside time spent setting up grinding; the “secret” train quest was more fun than most singularities as an endgame challenge. I also quite miss the times were rewards were relevant to the quests, random rewards/lootboxes really made progress awkward these days.\nI may sound like a downer, and that’s because I am, the modpack is mostly carried by existing systems and mods, so I didn’t really find much special in it (the boss was pretty unique and fun). It’s not bad, it’s simply very standard kitchen sink, and that’s not what I have fun with. Regardless, you might enjoy it more than me so give it a try!\n\n\n\nAnother chapter ends in this grand adventure!"

    "text": "A year ends, and a new one begins. So many things happen and it’s easy to forget what happened recently, let’s then take a look back to imprint in memory what was seen during the year and regroup all the reviews in one place. I’ll first list all the elements of a category, then have a handful of titles for the more memorable ones. However because something is listed isn’t equivalent to a mark of quality, or a lack thereof if it’s not awarded a title. It’s worth seeing for yourself if something would feel interesting or not, I will add an excerpt to help giving an idea.\nOf course this is a wholly subjective evaluation and might include elements from before the current year because I experienced these first this year. Before deliberating on how impactful each was, I will do honorable mentions of every element for even being part of what I had the chance to try. Well done on having been made! Creation is a difficult and often ungrateful endeavor, so this is the least I can give to appreciate this.\n\nGames\n\nList\n\nImpostor Factory - Reality is what we perceive as such. But it’s important to discern what is real outside of our perception, otherwise it becomes an illusion we get lost in. Don’t mistake one world for another…\nOri and the Will of the Wisps - Life is neither fair nor unfair, all it cares about is the cycle of life and death to perpetuate. Yet, caring isn’t superfluous, each individual cycle does matter. There’s no point in giving up early.\nOuter Wilds - A vast world of manifold elements, when combined they bring infinite possibilities and in that, solutions to most questions. The question then becomes, do you truly want to get an answer for it?\nChaos;Head NoaH - It is easy to become complacent and lose yourself in delusions. Facing reality will take pain and effort, but it’s something all too important to protect what is truly mattering. Are your eyes yours?\nAra and the Empty Universe - What a strange experience.\nOur Way Down - Interested in seeing what’s next.\nSteins;Gate: My Darling’s Embrace - Nothing mind-blowing, but it doesn’t hurt.\nDOOM Eternal - Dip into the slaughter, can it really be called a power fantasy when any mistake is fatal? Every progress here is made through blood and tears. Only rule: rip the rewards and tear the obstacles down!\nThe Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog - Surprisingly fun.\nBottoms Up! Part 1 - It reminds a bit of the Witcher, if it was a lot more realistic.\nRobotics;Notes Elite - Staying grounded is important, but having a dream to drive us is just as much. Mixing both is how you can combine the strengths and lessen the flaws, progressing forward with united goals.\nChaos;Child - There is an apparent higher production value/quality, yet somehow something feels missing.\nOneShot - Choosing to believe or not is what determines your reality, and while it might not reflect for others or the main one, sometimes it’s enough just for yourself.\nThe Looker - It’s silly, witty, but most importantly a love letter.\nAI: The Somnium File - Nirvana Initiative - Understanding isn’t always a necessity to fall in love. Simply feeling it can be enough, and even nothingness can lead to a state of ascension. Tear at the seams.\nInscryption - Even in a moment of comfort, the familiar is yet unfamiliar, and dread comes from the known unknown. Those dreadful changes are what brings necessary evolution to encrusted doors.\nThe Hex - Success can blind and make you forget what led you to it. At the same time, it can become a dreadful machine stopping you from reverting on the ruinous path. Every light casts shadows.\nBlasphemous 2 - All is preordained, if so, is it fate to be fighting against it? Strange will to be self deleterious, anything goes when nothing makes a difference. What’s left is to fight for convictions.\nSteins;Gate 0 - I wasn’t hooked from start to finish, but I won’t say I hated it either.\nOmori - Escape is not an exit, it’s longer alternate way before reaching one. Things have a cost and sometimes it feels too heavy to bear, but how much will we let it run before we wish for the initial price.\nRobotics;Notes DaSH - Consider this like a beach episode mixed with a sequel.\nThe Talos Principle 2 - Can we learn from past mistakes? If failure is inherent, should we even try? Would hope be enough to avoid the pitfalls? Could overwhelming power really be worth the risks? There is no right answer.\n\n\n\nTitles\n\nSpace has never been this attractive\n\nOuter wilds managed to instill a sense of wonder and exploration never before felt. It impacted how I view open world and puzzling.\n\nReady to blow your brains out\n\nDOOM Eternal completely overturned DOOM 2016, which had already overturned nervous gameplay that even I, not liking FPS games much, was conquered by. There’s a tightness and intensity unmatched here.\n\nI don’t like Mecha, however…\n\nRobotics;Notes Elite is a chiller one in the Sci;Adv franchise, it should have been my least liked one because the story involves robots and mecha. Surprisingly it did a great job of accompanying someone that dislikes them, and in the end was an interesting one.\n\nParody is not dead\n\nThe Looker overturned my whole experience of The Witness, it was fun and didn’t fall into cheap tricks. Well orchestrated.\n\nLet’s have deep existential philosophy in our game\n\nThe Talos Principle 2 took what was built in the first, and went even farther with the pondering and meaning of existence. All that along fun puzzles to dilute the thinking a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft Maps\n\nList\n\nPatchwreck - A proof that event maps can be fun even with experimental stuff. review\nSanctimonious Rhapsody 3: Revelations - The gameplay style is completely changed from the outset, meaning you don’t approach familiar things the same way. review\nUntold Stories 09: Castlemania - It is a good map, and it manages to offset the quality scope creep that such a series had. review\nBoots - The layout feels a bit random and loot chests are fairly equal in each area. review\nChain Zap Unchained - Bigger, better, stronger. review\nThe Distant Lands II - Starblight Desert - This is what good vanilla feels. review\nDans le Puits - It’s absolute chaos. review\nFeverdreams 1: Potatoe - Life is potato. review\nNausea - I got used to the effect fairly fast, and would have liked to experience something a bit more balanced to truly test it out. review\nTrails of Green and Gray - The gameplay is both familiar and unusual, with some use of very fast spawners for increased difficulty. review\nThe Lights Are Out - Not much more to say, it’s short and explores a gameplay idea. review\nThe Hub - It’s a funner Diversity, I like how it’s also a mix of “open world” with bits and bobs to fiddle around. review\nDeadly Sandstone Mines - I think I’m allergic to the old school gameplay grind, so after losing most of my gear, I just gave up - it wasn’t for me. review\nThe Lucid Dreamers #2 - Heatwave - It definitely felt like a lucid dream. review\nLucid Dreams 1.5 - Frostbound - The pressure of nat spawns combined with very open places made it not worth fighting, and now I need to do skeleton therapy. review\nSinful Skylands: Feast and Fortune - The areas are fun and the custom textures/items give a nice flavor(get it?). review\nBroiled Worlds 1: BIGTREE - This is probably the most vanilla ctm I’ve ever played. review\nIcecream Meltdown - This was a strange experience. review\nToilet Under Maintenance - I like the unique biotopes of each room along with the new plants. review\nThe Last Morning - There were clear improvements in level design and reward for exploration, I can see a hold was taken in those concepts. review\nLucid Nightmares 3 - The Empress - I like the cohesive theme for all the objectives, while it’s not too relevant past the first, you still get the feeling it’s all part of one world. review\nContrary - I’m so happy to see a map incorporate a puzzle like that. They’re fun and twist the mundane! review\nUncomplete - It starts a bit weak but goes hard as you progress. I had quite a lot of fun. review\nSun Guardian - Honestly, I’m shocked this is a first map, it’s reminiscent of Paradigm and Weaves of Fate in how much effort outputs such a massive and fun first map. review\nSandman’s Dimension - I think the biggest trap when playing this map is thinking it’s a standard ctm, it’s first and foremost a giant open world to traverse. review\nMapwreck 5 - Currents - Due to the linear progression and spread area locations, it was a bit annoying to follow the set order by running around.\nMidland - There were shortcomings, but I really liked the concept of skills and relics.\n-賭城風雲錄 Alea Iacta Est- - The sheer chaos of each floor, combined with the great theming, and wacky items give the whole experience a particular feeling. review\nExplorer’s Undergate - The style was too vanilla for my tastes but there’s still bits like the npc trades or green that change things up. review\nEpisodes of the Infernal - The biggest strength of the map is level design, it’s made to be played, not explored with secrets to find. review\nVoid Hero - The more you progress the crazier the map becomes. review\nQuickfire #22: Roselit Rush - The mechanics are well made and interesting, I regret not being able to enjoy it as much. review\nSky Frontier - With funny balance and simple gameplay, it’s short enough to stay fun to the end. review\nDINO’s Disadventures 01 - Novelty - It’s as short as advertised, if you want something to do for a small hour, it does the job fine. review\n6HM - Biggest regret is it’s too short so all feels compressed for progression. review\nHaunted Chills - A Sandurs Halloween special. review\nFinal Paradox - It’s rare to have big maps with production value like that, so each should be savored.\nThe Ultimate CTMC Quiz - Finally I can capitalize on all the hours well spent here. review\nRiptide Summit - The map used the riptide movement well for traversal, gameplay was fast and fun. review\nTree Exploration - The item quality is varied with some punishing drawbacks on some(which makes it hard to consider a use) and other good standard ones(also an infinity unbreakable bow whew). review\nSandman’s Gift - It was a more mixed experience, the highlight being the level design which had fun ideas and gameplay. review\nFungal-Floric Up-Down Hoedown - It’s a very vanilla style map, we can see the aesthetics and level design are basic, but they’re there and only ask to find a strong identity in the future. review\nA Renewing Adventure - The bite sized is accurate, having small maps is a good balance to not always needing to go on 30 hours adventures. review\nSanta’s Naughty List - Next time is krampus? I guess I better be silent… review\nCurse Of The Snowy Desert - Nooo! Why am I cursed… The loot certainly is, it was interesting having to figure out if the item was good to use or not. review\nClosing Time - The plushies were so cute! review\nOtter Wilds - Not to mistake with the otter worlds. review\nCorrupted Winter - The mobs lived up to the hard difficulty, remember to frequently take a nap while progressing! review\nThe Snow Globe - Can’t learn without making, mistakes included. review\nVortex of Ordeal - I hate you. review\nParalyzed - I went for a walk on the beach and all I got was those lousy burns. review\nMelted Spires - Expect it to be nervous because it’s not an easy climb. review\n-= Trials of the Sorcerer =- - A very solid and fun map, don’t fear the difficulty too much, because it’s generous enough to let you experiment. review\nSolaris - I wasn’t favored by the map. review\nSanta Boss Battle - No gifts? Time to get them back with interests. review\nSandbox Forces - Don’t expect it to play like a standard CTM, it’s quite fun in its own way. review\nFight for a Night Snack - I spoke too soon, but I’m not late, here’s the real last gift of 2023! review\n\n\n\nTitles\n\nAvant-Guarde\n\nSanctimonious Rhapsody 3: Revelations was a real moment. With unusual textures and sounds, it really pushed how a ctm map can feel like and play. The final wool was a great challenge to overcome.\n\nParadigm Shift\n\nSun Guardian is a first map, did you know? Yet it feels as big as the biggest maps, a long adventure in perspective. It also had many interesting designs explored, I can’t praise it enough.\n\nBlock of the Wild\n\nSandman’s Dimension opens a big toybox of floating blocks to play around with, with no direct bridges it asks you to be inventive and explore around your way. The most “exploration in open world” fun I had this year, even if it was the only gameplay.\n\nSkyblock is outclassed\n\nVoid Hero has such an different approach to building the map, it reminds me of the ZungryWare style. I had a lot of fun finding all the different things and optional objectives. I love those kind of diverse checklist goals, and wish more maps would try some.\n\nFlawed Masterpiece\n\nFinal Paradox, what hasn’t been said about it? It’s clear there are issues, mechanics don’t fit all the time and level design can feel lacking. But it’s just such a blast to play, with epic boss battles and crazy items. The scales broke under the sheer weight.\n\nHighway to Heaven\n\nTrials of the Sorcerer is a great map, but there’s more to it. It has a gameplay style I really vibe with, and not being the only one pushing for it givz m hop for the future CTM maps we’ll see. Having so much places to explore and optional bits of content gives a particular feeling to maps, especially open worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft Modpacks\n\nList\n\nStoneBlock 3 - It’s not bad, it’s simply very standard kitchen sink, and that’s not what I have fun with.\nCraft of the Titans - It was a try that birthed a better version I’m eager to try one day!\nRoguelike Adventures and Dungeons - It had so many mods, but they were far from necessary.\n\n\n\nTitles\n\nWhat a disappointment\n\nRoguelike Adventures and Dungeons is a big modpack that I often heard about, but when I played it I was quite underwhelmed, clearly I had a wrong impression of what it would be. One of the rare I ever gave up on the middle of. Or is it the first?\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Up\nWhat a year! Despite being busy with some particular projects, I still managed to play many of the games I had planned to, along with the huge amount of CTM map releases. The modpacks were less glorious, but I won’t lose hope I’ll find some great ones! The games were so incredibly stacked with masterpieces I couldn’t afford to give a title to all of them, but know there’s a lot more I loved enough to consider part of the best. This new year should see an enormous game down, hopefully it’ll go well. I might add even more categories…\nMore promising things to come, see you soon!"

    "title": "Review of Mapwreck 4 - Twisted Regions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Map Author: CTMC\nOrigin: Map Link\nVersions: MC = 1.18.1\n\n\nPresentation\nMapwreck 4 - Twisted Regions is a full length CTM map. It was made under a week with over 30 mapmakers.\nThis map was played in multiplayer.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Escape\n\n\n\nTES?\n\n\nThe start felt strange. The level is a bit chaotic and built like a normal ctm area, but it’s in adventure mode.\n\n\nMolten Geysers\n\n\n\nWorld 8 moment.\n\n\nWalking into the portal got us teleported above the map, Cango fell to his death. Meanwhile I jumped to the monument directly after being a bit lost, so I never saw the area.\n\n\nThe Monument\n\n\n\nComing down they turned the tide!\n\n\nIt’s a nice hub area, although a bit too large for the content it has. It’s fun exploring and finding stuff.\n\n\nAzalea Ruin\n\n\n\nRings of pain.\n\n\nIt had an interesting layout to navigate, a nice first area to tackle. A bit repetitive for the ring segments.\n\n\nPrism Caves\n\n\n\nFairly urban for caves though.\n\n\nPretty cool overall, the larger than usual detection range is interesting to push forward combat. I like it when areas have various paths to enter from.\n\n\nMine Field\n\n\n\nWarning, flammable hazard.\n\n\nIt was unique and fun. I was surprised by the hidden second half.\n\n\nMisty Descent\n\n\n\nResidence Evil.\n\n\nSimple but effective level design, good variance in gameplay.\n\n\nThe Tainted Oasis\n\n\n\nNothing in the big tree in the middle, sad.\n\n\nThe paths were too large, it was too easy to just run past the spawner trail. Also the poison water still affected me while in the boat. The blockvar is a bit too busy imo.\n\n\nFrozen Arches\n\n\n\nDon’t get cold feet here.\n\n\nThe terrain was hard to navigate, even in the interiors. I appreciate the lower speed baby zombies, made them more tolerable. The snow traps were too deep, annoying to dig out of.\n\n\nMycelial Badlands\n\n\n\nFlytrap oasis.\n\n\nThe mobs and spawnrate felt overtuned. We were a bit miserable going through it, had to wander for a while in the dark or accidently torch myself to death.\n\n\nMagician’s Hideaway\n\n\n\nDeath comes from below.\n\n\nIt was pretty tense and fun with a wacky layout, items and mobs.\n\n\nChantry of the Singularity\n\n\n\nDon’t get dizzy.\n\n\nThe giant room needed more variance. The bottom part was like a jump boost area but without the permanent boost. It was a bit of a drag due to having to bridge while fighting blazes. Overall I think it was more a flawed design than execution here.\nIf you make a mandatory mechanic, you need to give it at the start of the area and not in limited amounts, because it won’t be used otherwise(or running out midway).\nLooks unique.\n\n\nBottomside Lighthouse\n\n\n\nI don’t know why it reminds me of Crimson Bay’s Treasure.\n\n\nIt was a cute and short area. Also ohno, is that natural spawns?\n\n\nAngler’s Dwelling\n\n\n\nMines snapshot?\n\n\nA bit confusing, didn’t end up doing much here personally.\n\n\nTropical Trials\n\n\n\nTropicraft sure got a facelift.\n\n\nThe nat spawns really started being a major nuisance here. Lots of mobs overall. It felt like the latter half was made for an un- map, even more with the blazes making lava flow everywhere.\n\n\nCelestial Archipelago\n\n\n\nTreetop village without the treetops… or the village.\n\n\nBit confusing to move around, stressful due to void. It was fine. It could’ve been more pleasant with larger paths.\n\n\nIce Route\n\n\n\nDon’t drive fast on icy roads.\n\n\nThere were stressful areas before, but this one is mean. Super punch skeletons on ice, oh dear.\n\n\nCrystal Dust Quarry\n\n\n\nDigging a hole…\n\n\nThe area was more carto spam than a carto area, proving “carto spam” to be a fallacy.\nEvery mob is elite tier, and even at two people, we were extremely overwhelmed by the sheer amount and strength. Even more when they combined with the overabundant natural spawns. So many creepers… Somehow the piglins duplicated raw gold and golden apples, so we ended up with many stacks of those.\nThe effort is praiseworthy. If only the custom mobs were toned down a lot; they’re all individually great, having each all together is the problem.\n\n\nColorless Land\n\n\n\nChromatic dichotomy.\n\n\nStrange layout, very spread out so it’s simple to bypass a lot. The mobs were a relief after the grinder we went through. The items had some conception mishaps.\nStrange theme, unique though.\n\n\nThe Shrieking Mists\n\n\n\nWhy.\n\n\nWas fairly interesting, until the wool box segment. That was an intentional un- map design, and it was the worst experience in the map so far. That’s coming not long after cyan’s mobs and it made me regret it.\n\n\nBasalt Fields\n\n\n\nPretty hot, huh?\n\n\nPretty good and simple. Familiar sights. The charged creepers in the nat spawns are a bit eh.\n\n\nJester’s Mirage\n\n\n\nThe whole damned circus!\n\n\nEvery mob manages to be cursed in some way. Other than that, short area. The jester head is absurdly broken even by broken standards.\n\n\nThe Starved Ruins\n\n\n\nDelve deep in chocolate wonderland.\n\n\nVery fun, fairly balanced loot and mobs. Bit of a whacky layout but that made it fun to explore. Great area.\n\n\nDaredevil’s Keep\n\n\n\nYour fun is in another castle.\n\n\nWhere did balance go? Armor loot is subpar, the mobs are spammed and overly strong, very high numbers all around. The ravager button is very bruh(I broke the block but it still triggered).\n\n\nCyberlight Citadel\n\n\n\nToo grand to be fully captured with a single picture.\n\n\nExcellent area in level design and aesthetics. The mobs are the big problem, they were overtuned and overall too tanky. If stats were smaller to make it tolerable, this area would be easily the best one of the map.\n\n\nCrimson Cast\n\n\n\nIzzet discharge!\n\n\nIt was more interesting than expected, thanks to the shard dungeon. Loot is weird due to being after red but weaker than it.\n\n\nPurpur Fortress\n\n\n\nSo many extra areas…\n\n\nAnother random bonus area, the loot is worse than red so we just did it for… the sake of it I guess. I dislike jump boost so it was eh. Limiting it is not a good idea either for multiplayer. Flashbacks to the Chantry.\n\n\nInferno Chamber\n\n\n\nGarbodor?\n\n\nIt’s a thing I guess. Neat look from the outside.\n\n\nThe Abyssal Prison\n\n\n\nAlduin got jailed again.\n\n\nThe final gauntlet, the level layout is very perfunctory, with spawner trails to the wool. The combat is not as terrible as you could think, and with the loot it’s fairly even. Pretty boring overall(better than being a nightmare), it looks quite good. I think it should’ve had a random dragon roar periodically for epic ambience.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nA long and arduous journey.\n\n\nHalfway through we updated the datapacks, getting void protection and graves. That helped a lot to make it less brutal.\nFirst things to get out the way because it’s a mapwreck: the area gear progression and mob balance is uneven.\nSidenote on the fact that no Cartographer or Item Builder datapacks were used, and despite that, I think the map managed to fall in many pitfalls people usually warn about for these datapacks. Cyan especially had übermobs for every mob type. You could still find ridiculously OP items, which ironically went overboard more easily since you didn’t have the variety and limitations of the premade datapacks.\nI think in the end, this map served to prove that it’s not the tools the problem, it’s how things are made. Next time, instead of restricting design options, we should simply curate more the results.\nThe natural spawns were a major annoyance, and somehow they’d spawn near you if you’re several players.\nNow, the relevant point about this map in particular - the different way to make areas that was tried here is detrimental. It created an even more chaotic map with lots of extra area bits.\nI much prefer having the defined areas with an objective each. It accelerated area fatigue without making you progress more, as well as making you wonder why it was worth going through. Event maps already suffer from overscope, I don’t think this was the good answer.\nI have to complain about the bonus objectives as well. Too often, the shards were hidden next to the objective, which isn’t the best for content repartition. Bonus objectives are best done in a way to promote exploring side paths and places you wouldn’t go usually, this wasn’t it. Same for the netherite block, barely worth mentioning. That makes me want to handle them next Mapwreck…\nSo, what to say? This is a mapwreck map. I haven’t played the third yet, so it’s hard to judge, but there’s a good chance it ends up near the bottom. Hard to recommend due to the very uneven balance, but if you like playing mapwrecks, you might enjoy it.\nLet’s make a better one next time!"

    "text": "Modpack Author: Kehaan\nOrigin: Modpack Link\nVersions: MC = 1.12.2 - Pack = 1.0.9\n\nIt’s the beginning of a new adventure, and this time we’re going to delve into the Amnesia modpack! This pack is focused around recipes and loots being random, the player being struck by amnesia every 5 minutes.\nI’ll be noting everything in this journal to make sure I don’t forget any of it, so buckle up because we’re going to… what was I saying again?\n\nThis was an old post that was lost when the previous blog was shut down. By miracle it was salvaged through archives, but all the images were lost. All the quotes were supposed to be under a corresponding screenshot of the game. Enjoy this piece of history, the very first post ever made!\n\n\nI even forgot how the menu looked! Where do I start…\n\n\nNew Beginnings\nI started by figuring out how to start, which was a good start, and that led me in a pretty inhospitable place, just at the feet of snowy mountains.\n\nWelcome to the world of ???\n\nA quick look around to survey the land informed me it was a tundra all over, and a crevice just in front of me. I then took a quick glance in my inventory to see only 2 items: a book, and a bed pet.\n\nSo this is my goal, huh? Better not forget about it!\n\nI quickly understood that the bed pet would be very useful, and the book wouldn’t. Now that I knew what I had to aim for, I immediately started wandering around in the hopes of finding… something? Since all my knowledge was now meaningless, I wasn’t sure what I would even be searching for.\n\nCompletely not forgetting I had a bed pet, I hardly fought the night off!\n\nAfter gathering a decent amount of supplies, most of them unusable but potentially useful for crafting, I finally decided it would be safer to build a base (and totally not because my inventory was filled to the brim).\n\nI have this chest here, after so much effort! It was greatly needed…\n\nOnce again, barely surviving the night, I managed to finish up a frail looking hut and then tried to figure out the next step to advance. I started by trying to obtain some means of doing better crafts that would open my possibilities each amnesia. I also looked at my objectives and set myself reminders for most of the items I would need to frequently check in on if they had a lucky craft.\n\nAfter a lot of effort, I managed to obtain a crafting station! This is the beginning of a new era!\n\n\n\nSettling and Developing\nOnce I was able to access 3 by 3 crafts, it broadened my horizons by a lot and I even made a quantum quarry! Too bad I realized powering it would prove to be a hassle not worth the effort. During each intervals, I kept progressing a little, and managed to dwindle my list of goals as I obtained new things.\n\nThe biggest challenge of this pack being inventory management…\n\nDue to my newfound space issues, I set as my priority to make an ME storage system in the hopes it would make my life easier. I even planted seeds, began setting up a tinker craft, obtained a stack of angelheart vials, surely it meant things were going well! Little did I know all of it would never be of use to me in the end. I soon gave up on the ME storage as well due to power supply issues.\n\nAll of this spaaaaaace!\n\nGiving up on all the fancy tools, I started focusing on the essential things like my goals. I reached a new era when I obtained the uncrafting table, and it opened thrice as much opportunities! Shocking, I know right!!! In fact, I would desperately need nether stars to craft end game resources, and the ways to obtain a steady supply were looking scarce.\n\nSometimes, unraveling past memories can bring up treasures.\n\nOnce I knew how to obtain the hardest material, I was at the whims of fate to remember a favorable recipe. I decided it was finally time to go out and explore away! I found a small pirate ship not far from where I was, and it was a nice distraction until the next stroke of amnesia.\n\nI even looted some epic hat after the fight, yarr!\n\nNow that I was starting to explore, I would need to gain means of traveling but I had nowhere enough grid power to use my flying ring. At this moment, I had another stroke of genius, and figured that, if I couldn’t craft it, I could surely uncraft the dragon egg to use it on the mill I had obtained earlier!\n\nThere is no more place I can’t reach now!\n\nThanks to that, I flew randomly and found a nether portal pet in a cloud. How lucky, I was having troubles obtaining a lot of obsidian! With this I could easily hop in and out of there, I took a glance at the world of hell and left without another word. Once this was done, I could continue on my goals much more easily. I even tried my luck once and was rewarded with a lot of golden items!\n\nAnother dimension that went in a flash…\n\nI was now fully geared up, so I decided it was time to try my luck on fighting the wither! For some reason he started flying high in the sky and that led me to purchasing him and ending the fight at the maximum height. After all this fighting, I had enough uncrafted nether stars to start making the end game materials.\n\n\nThe Time of Adventure\n\nSo few goals left, but how arduous!\n\nDue to having to find an elder guardian and an evoker, I set off to different villages in the hopes of finding a cartographer. A lucky recipe made me obtain a lot of emeralds, so I could easily afford the costs. After a few more remaining materials obtained, and villages explored in the hope of a cartographer, I also went to find the end portal although I lacked enough eyes to open it.\n\nFinally I could go on a journey to my last goals.\n\nAt the same time, I had finally enough to craft one of the 3 endgame items, the amnesia clock to see the time left between each amnesia. Surely it was going to be helpful when so far away! During my travels, I found a few oddities in the landscape, but they weren’t worth my time to stop. First was the underwater temple, which I found relatively easily… and realized I would need a way to actually stay underwater. Time to go back home!\n\nShip ashore is a bad omen…\n\nAt home, I obtained just enough eyes so I decided to go defeat the ender dragon first. Even without a bow (I gave up on it after figuring out how annoying it’d be to craft arrows) he went down quite easily, and thus I hopped back into the overworld and continued the adventure.\n\nWith a bucket and my sword, the elder did not linger.\n\nAll that was left was the woodland mansion housing the evoker. During my trip I saw strange obsidian towers that shouldn’t belond to this world… but it didn’t surprise me anymore. I raided the place which was several thousand meters away from my home, and again started the trip back. Only one place left to visit!\n\nThe final end game crafts which ended up useless to me.\n\nIt was finally time to enter the final dimension and bring an end to this madness! Immediately coming out of the portal, I found a naga courtyard and a lich tower, making quick work of them. Then it was the turn of the ice queen, the hydra and the ur-ghast. The biggest challenge would be to gather all the wools for the questing ram… did I think, at least. As I managed to do it, nothing happened, and to my dismay, I realized I was mistaken and only needed to kill it to begin with. Oh well.\n\nEvery great accomplishment needs a sacrifice!\n\n\n\nAt Journey’s End\nDuring this experience, I would have learned a few things, but overall, most of my time was spent trying to remember better recipes. In fact that’s pretty much all you’ll ever do, so honestly it wasn’t really that fun.\nAnd with this, I write my last words in this journal with hopes that whoever reads it can gain some insight about it! It is time for me to close this chapter of my story and open a new one - orian34\n\nAnd thus, with my freshly obtained trophy, the curtains closed on this adventure."
