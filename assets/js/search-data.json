            "title": "Review of Project 2M",
            "content": "Author: Ty and Kunii Origin: Map Link . Presentation . Project 2M is a full length CTM map. It is hard and open world. . I’m very squeamish about playing hard maps, since I’m not a fan usually, but I heard enough praise that I decided to try it myself. . Overview . White . The start is harsh. Better not fall into the void with the starting wood or you can reset. The campfire is confusing with no explanations, but it becomes fairly obvious once you reach another one. The struggle with wooden gear is real, but aside archers, it’s all manageable. . Not a fan of having tanky ranged skeletons this early. Natural spawns are always a nuisance, but it’s especially bad here. . Orange . Mean traps and daunting combat, but wood and cool are plentiful here and there’s even a good amount of stone. Ups and downs on the ledge is a bit stressful, but it’s rewarding a whole new gear tier. The giant cavern is looking like a big intersection, and finding the second objective this soon is a relief. That means areas aren’t super massive and are finely segmented even in the same space. . Since you emerge low of resources, there’s a big chance you’ll tackle this area second as you go mine to suit up for the danger ahead. Smart placement. . Magenta . Really tense and dangerous, felt like walking the tightrope. The kind of areas only hard maps would make, it was refreshing and great. . Not as deadly as it looks to be… as long as you don’t let a creeper blow up a tnt stack. . Gray . After this point, that’s where people will likely spread out in the progression, as you get a whopping 7 possible areas to go to. I chose to go to the mineshaft area since it was closest and seemed to contain good resources. . The start is filled with trigger happy wipe traps but thankfully calms down later. The mobs on the other hand are very unassuming but easily kill you in 2-3 hits with full chain armor. I thought they were overtuned until I got the objective, which made sense since it’s what would be considered the halfway point of the map. Lovely suspended bridges area. . The iron nugget ore is very smart and a good way of having armor progression feel more natural(even though I completely skipped leather and gold I guess). . Yellow . After the previous mistake, I tried tackling the easiest looking area, and it wasn’t too far off the mark. I’m not surprised it wasn’t light blue, considering how yellow everything looked. . It was fun and balanced overall, the complaint would be that there was so much damn natural spawns, it burned all my gear and resources. . A good experience of why I don’t like natural spawns and how annoying they can be. It didn’t help that the whole top of the temple is a waste of time with so much fighting for a stick. . Light Blue . While the color is similar, it’s not very intuitive to have an early area with nether blocks as it’s usually ominous. . This place is basically an exacerbation of yellow’s natural spawn issues due to the terrible vegetation. If clogging your inventory and annoyingly disrupting combat was a boss, this would be it. The fun parts at the end got doused after triggering an unfair wipe trap. . Pink . The looks of a final area, complete with a midway checkpoint, but it’s actually just the 7th area. Probably the best area so far, with magenta being close. It’s fun and dangerous, with lots of ranged enemies, but nothing really mean. . Some pretty good items in the few chests to loot. The layout made natural spawns more reasonable and likely helped in making it the best experience. Oh, and the heart coral blocks slowly decaying really help sell the “killing the beast” feel. . Lime . Pretty fun, clean castle conquest area. The illusioner spawners were a bit overkill, when 4 spawned at once I just left. . Light Gray . Like a redo of Magenta, but much more dangerous with sand traps instead of tnt. The many additions of ranged mobs makes it less pleasant, and a single mistake leads to getting wiped. It was fine, but after 5 wipes I wanted to be done with it sooner than later. . Cyan . The natural spawns became so much I almost gave up and quit, but instead decided to do the latter half of the map with them disabled. Now keep in mind any area done next will be considerably easier than intended. . This made me remember what swarmming was(swimming in mob swarms). The last map that had it was Dark Realms: Odyssey also by Kunii… coincidence? I think not. . Poison water and suspended bridges are unironically fun. . Brown . Really unique and interesting. Would’ve been a great area if the hardest segment wasn’t after obtaining the wool. You only have 3 tries and after that, guess the map’s over. (I know about homeward bones, but you can’t expect the player to not spend their limited resources to progress) . Purple . That one is incredibly massive. The river ruins segment is fine, although the knockback zombies feel way overtuned since getting sent in the water is not only a death sentence, but also painful to gather the items back. You’ll be forced to look at your items despawn in front of you. . The water swim unlock felt straight out of a Metroidvania, and that’s probably what I love most so far. The castle section was quite fun, reminds me it’s possible to enjoy playing, I don’t regret removing nat spawns. . Blue . It was fun, confusing in a good way, and refreshing. You just need to be smart and stay on the teleporters to dodge ambushes. . Also, fire, hue hue. . Red . Alright, I found my favorite area of the map. It’s difficult, but not because of power creep, and that’s good design. Feeling the dread while exploring is scary, while also never going overboard to unfairly threaten the player. . The feelings of being lost while stumbling in the dark was game changing in a fun way. . Black . A bit disappointing after red, but I guess that’s what you should expect from a final area in a hard “oldschool” map. Lots of hard combat with bedrock, cobwebs and lava, it becomes numbing after a while. I don’t even want to imagine the purgatory that is doing it with natural spawns. . Conclusion . Globally, the natural spawns are the main annoyance, due to low visibility and lots of space to light up they are incredibly obnoxious. They’re too disruptive to be enjoyable, I’ll largely prefer Horrifeye spawns for a hard type map. . There is the right amount of forgiveness in resource renewal… if you don’t count the many wipe traps. You have to learn to manage your resources to go far here. . The open world aspect is top notch, with lots of options available and only surviving to guide you. On the other hand, weapons don’t really progress much, you’ll spend a majority of the map with unenchanted stone swords with only near the end getting to iron. Gets a bit weary after a while. . The way the mobs and combat are tuned heavily push you into using swords, especially near the end game, due to mob spam forcing fast strikes and higher durability. Bit annoying to not have a real choice. . The map had larger spaces than usual with nothing more of interest, which is likely due to being designed around natural spawns. I guess that’s normal, but at the same time, the design suffers from it. This map just confirmed even more why I disliked natural spawns… . The bonfires and homeward bones are a really fun way to have checkpoints, flavor is on point too. . I couldn’t find green, and brown was burned(I looked back and the exit after the wool is basically impossible to go through, what a poor and cruel joke), and since I disabled natural spawns halfway through, I probably don’t deserve to say I beat the map. But I don’t care about that. . It is a hard and mean map, but as long as you like suffering(or remove nat spawns), then you’ll find a nice experience here. I can’t recommend it otherwise. .",

            "title": "Walking Through Enigmatica 2 Expert",
            "content": "Author: NillerMedDild Origin: Modpack Link . Presentation . Enigmatica 2 Expert is an elaborate Minecraft modpack with a push towards tech. . Important to specify that I finished playing it a year ago, and after some events lost the old walkthrough post along the previous blog place, so this is a retell of a recent story before it is lost to memory. . Overview . Garden of Eden . Thus starts the adventure in this world, my eyes lay on the surroundings, showing a peaceful apple orchard next to the sea. The most important goal right now is to quickly clear up space for a small camp, to prepare the base of operations. Gathering some flint from the nearby waterside, I obtained a full set of simple tools ready for use. I quickly got to work and set up a basic smeltery to mold some metal parts and upgrade my tools. The mine goes deeper and I find more and more ores to various uses, even some diamonds! While digging, I find some vis crystals so I decide to spend more time in researching that field. Advances in technology progress fast on the side, with upgrade kits allowing me to open a portal to the nether and bringing the hell ores back. . Power, Mysticism and Astrology . Exploration yielded several more materials needed to unlock gates leading to different mods. I can get started in several directions and get access to new machines, albeit not very efficient, for better ore production. A small step for tech, a leap for magic. I setup a very simple mana production, then a great sky temple for the stars, and even a blood altar! With my few power means, I can produce some rubber and begin semi-automatizing some resources using pipes. Business is booming, I even get to make a mystical agriculture gem. My expedition yielded some precious materials, and for the first time ever I learned how to use rituals! I use them to boost my crop growth to great effect, and I’m sure this will end up a major tool later on… Another trip to the nether and my blood altar receives a lot of upgrades, efficiency primes! My first terrasteel made, I decide it’s the right time to setup a mob farm since I have all the tools available and a mob slaughter factory. I use a solar panel from a loot crate and it’s good enough to sustain it at this stage. . The End of Beginnings . All the required elements assembled, two portals could be opened, the most important one leading to the End. Having astral gateways is really handy, huh… With a slew of new materials available, I continue on my endeavors, with some risky experimentation and electrical upgrades. Being well advanced in magical matters, I look to the tech side for improvements. Getting better machines means the power grid is taking a hit, and I’ll admit I never was a great energy supplier. Scraping by so far, I get a major machine that will matter(haha) for the rest of the pack: the matter fabricator. The duplicating fluid producer… With so many options, I have a lot of work of setup to start making use of all the new means of production. I get smarter and use a power cell as buffer during the day for another solar panel to keep powering the night. The replicator is installed and while the amount of fluid is a bit low, the option to duplicate specific items is appearing! My power explodes after obtaining some RTGs(some sort of self-generator) and production goes full throttle. This is the first time I feel so liberated from power constraints, and quests are unbridled, downing them by the dozen. The industrial revolution is coming! . On the Matter of Machines . The UU-Matter(duplicating fluid) is being produced much faster now, and a good amount of the complex casings can be replicated, allowing me to bypass recipes after the first time. I even started making my own uranium RTGs to have self-powered machines more spread out and almost all of the gates are opened! All this free ore definitively solves resource shortage aside some exceptions, and the biggest change is on the horizon. I finally make an ME Controller, no more slog through chests, it’s disk storage time(although I’m still very new to it)! I tried various ways to produce more power but they all ended up severely disappointing… I’ll stay with my RTGs. Despite the poor attempts, the power generated is still worthy of use, and I install garden cloches for the mystical seeds as well as a laser miner for more ores. Seeing how spread out everything begins to be, I make use of draconic power crystals to bypass the need of power conduits. Veeery handy! I crafted a radar that was originally made for ore detection, but I went a step above and tuned it to detect chests. With this, I can easily find out dragon dens from the amount of chests showing up, it’s time to be rich! This yields a tremendous amount of resources for better RTGs and most importantly, dragon eggs! This will be handy for forging dragonsteel. . Digital Era . I’ve gotten more confident in my refined storage usage, and now that I can access wirelessly my crafting interface, I truly changed the paradigm. I begin by linking all my production using an enderchest network and assemble a ridiculously strong dragonsteel sword with many enchantments on it. Poor wither has become a punching bag… Growing, growing, the tree of life is growing. I’ve received some advice on how to utilize better my storage system, for the fabled autocrafting! So I began growing my crafting tree of life… I’ve been told interfaces were everything with this version, and spoiler, it was correct. First step of autocrafting, install a way to autocraft the materials needed to expand the autocrafting. After crushing the enhanced guardian of gaia, I begin the great renovation in the basement, with a lot of self sufficient machines that run by themselves for autocrafting. All these resources will be at a click’s reach! As my tree expands, I become needy of more power once again, pushing me to look into reactors and other cheap ways. I line up RTGs above my garden cloches and set up a melon farm to produce ethylene and power a turbine generator. The production is self sufficient, and for once the effort was worth it because wowie the output is delicious. The more turbines I’ll add, the more power generated, it can keep on growing! I found the solution to my energy problems definitively this time. . Breaking Down Rules . With the efficiency of the dragon crystals, transmitting power to everything is child’s play, and I can even grow my crafting tree of life along the garden cloches. Everything has become easy to power and I don’t have to fear an outage. Since I can afford it now, I build an arc furnace next to my mob farm to melt all the useless gear pieces dropped to add some extra materials to my stash. Everything is easy to power and make now, so I install a void miner to have it function on the side, because they always take forever to go up tiers. The roots of my tree keep expanding as more autocrafting takes place with new machines. Progress goes by leaps and bounds, and there’s even machines to automate crafting from thaumcraft and astral sorcery! How wonderful, I’m living the dream currently. I also upgraded the void miner and found a secret page to explain what the corrupted version of the Horologium ritual does… this will be useful, I can sense it. I quickly go through the twilight forest progression to defeat the Ur-Ghast and… Did I mention I love this mod? It’s my favorite dimension mod for years now, and it’s always a pleasure to go through it, even while being overpowered. Anyway, I need a ton of void seeds, so it’s time to corrupt the plane of existence… Thankfully I have the means to make it more efficient now. . To Infinity and Beyond . While finally being able to craft better platings for nuclear machines and RTGs, a massive corruption outbreak happens not too far from my mob farm, oh dear… Thankfully it doesn’t expand too much and stays fairly contained, as long as I regularly kill the abominations popping up. Meanwhile I place down an excavator to obtain bauxite, as that’s the only known way to obtain it and make ender IO casings. I probably forgot to mention it, but at some point I added more ethylene generators. You don’t change a winning formula! I needed the power to keep expanding with all the new machines, especially since I’ll be preparing a rocket soon. You can’t skimp out on resources for this. The big machines are getting expansive, but thankfully my autocrafting system is keeping up and I’m never on the backfoot. I even added a special space floor to get in the mood and refill with oxygen. A tower later and my rocket is filled, it’s adventure time! Although I totally didn’t forget to first send a base into space… and use a homing system so the rocket comes back… Ok, truth is I had to make another rocket. Anyway, the new planets have what I needed, and some extras! This allows me to begin building some extreme reactors and eye the draconic evolution things. . Going Big . It’s a bit difficult, but I understand how to have autocrafting work on the extended crafting tables. After all, this is going to be a necessity for all the late game stuff. I start looking into the needed materials to make machine chassis, needed for the last tier of ender IO machines. I know the pain will be unavoidable, the singularities will be unavoidable, I don’t have a choice but to set it up now instead of later… While it runs on its own, I work hard on crafting costly elements. To that goal, I even added another mob room with a powered spawner for specific drops farming. Through toil and trouble, the fusion crafting core is ready for use, the final crafting tiers have been reached… Almost. Using some redstone for safety heatlock, a stronger and better nuclear reactor helps power surging for the huge power demand of fusion crafting. The moment has come to progress in draconic evolution, and I heard horror stories about it… Thankfully, I don’t have to rematch against it ever again in this pack, because the shard dropped is replicable, muahahaha! Upgrading my fusion crafting is child’s play now. This opens another final tier production, the neutron collector. And oh dear is this slow… . Going Home . A daunting task suddenly stops me in my tracks, I have to make a fusion core reactor and it seems incredibly obtuse and annoying. After pain, sweat, and tears, I manage to make it work without issues, but my past self was right I don’t like it. The oh-so-precious neutron fluid in my possession, the ultimate ingots ready, I’m only a few steps away from the creative tank. The necessary first step to break the endgame. The tank here, the neutron fluid is now a joke that I can infinitely produce, hah! Any fluid in my possession can be freely duplicated effortlessly, this will be a huge help for making the singularities. More singularities, more! Hahahahaha, hahaha, hahahahahahaaaa… AAAAAAAH! To avoid becoming insane, I clear out all the remaining quests in all the stages I haven’t yet completed. This is the last sliver of sanity I can preserve. All these efforts leading to making more ultimate singularities and the remaining elements… Everything culminates to make the ultimate ingot… which can be duplicated using the tank! This huge step done, I can fairly easy make the creative power cell for infinite RF, and making the creative gas tank is simple too. Then the final step, after major lag to autocraft the tier 6 solar generators, the creative vending upgrade, which allows duplicating items without restrictions. The pack is basically over at this point! . Conclusion . This is it then, I’ll be honest, I didn’t remember every twist and turn but hopefully this retelling was accurate enough to be enjoyable. . It was tough while keeping the grind fair(for an expert pack), and it made good use of the various mods, having the recipes interconnected to progress. . I had fun and I’ll be seeing you in another world! .",

            "title": "Review of Saturnine Memories",
            "content": "Author: ZeyD_ Origin: Map Link . Presentation . Saturnine Memories is a medium length CTM map. It is in hub style with all areas available from the monument area. . This was done with a beta version, so some things might have changed since. . Overview . Monument . The start is nice and chill, with no lack of resources although we don’t have access to stone yet. The elite mob just incentivized not fighting it because of corpse crawler and I ended up sending them into holes. . Bigger than usual monument areas, it’s a nice central hub although with some extra walking. I do have to complain about the bonus monument and trader being too far from the base. . Green . This area has an interesting mix of paths, buildings and temple to explore. But it’s not perfect as it lacks variance in those, after clearing a few buildings you’ll know the rest of them. It could benefit from having more handmade details to differentiate each, the human brain is very susceptible to repetition because it lowers the stimulation due to known patterns. Reaching the temple is refreshing. . The layout suffered also from being fairly mirrored, with several paths to the big temple where it obviously leads to the objective. Losing content as not many player will bother exploring it all. The inside of the temple also has some mirroring, but much less. . The mobs were all fine except the archers, which were annoying to deal with since they completely negated melee. This early in the map, it would’ve been preferable to have a lesser effect or another type. The golden sword was great. . Cyan . Here, the variance was better due to the path, but inversely, I feel like it could’ve had more building gameplay. Better details but lower level variance. Despite how confusing it looks, there is a main path to follow which leads to the objective. I feel sorry for the player if he decides to skip around the road though. . I appreciate the waterfalls to get back to where we are if we die, it really prevents nightmare scenarios near the end. . Despite being stronger, the archers felt better to fight because they would die without too much trouble, unlike the previous area. Found the best helmet as well. . Light Gray . My favorite area, it was fun and the mobs are nice(yes even the vexes!) to fight. It has great items, good mix of tunnels, platforms, mines and dungeon layout. And a strider safari bit, although it sadly isn’t really part of the path, it’s only for extra exploration. The shortcut use was smart although the placement of the crossroad can lead the player to just pillar up since the path leads away from the castle. . The only and best eruption pickaxe of the map. . Black . This area has the best visuals. The town in the fortress outskirts has fun personalization of the buildings. Although comes back the problem from Green, it lacks variance for the interiors in gameplay. The upper fortress was great and the mean invisible crawling labyrinth was worth the torture! . Combat was a bit let down for me, with mostly tanky mobs and no effective weapon(except a rare one). . Red . And so comes the final showdown. And if the previous area was the best visually, this one has the best vibe(the heartbeats were great). The hyper cousin of Horrifeye’s last area, which are legally unaffiliated, holds the toughest combat and best gear. . The use of keys was appropriate for the layout and was clear enough to avoid ending at a loss. Void was present, but never as an unfair threat. . Conclusion . For starters, everything looks breathtaking. The building style has clear inspirations from Ragecraft and Simulation Protocol and it looks gorgeous. It is clear that artistic direction is the main strength here, but the custom items and mobs weren’t half bad either. . Although this is also where the entropy syndrome appears; due to aesthetics being prioritized, the level layout suffers in gameplay. It consisted mostly in spawners trailing on the path, which while not bad, lacks of unique level design strength. On the other hand, the signs indicating it wasn’t worth going in the decorations were greatly appreciated. Being unsure of the mapmaker’s intentions in terms of loot and secrets is vital to avoid pointless trekking. . The custom formatting on the items meant that you weren’t able to see changes when using the anvil, making it hard to track or even not aware of it even working. A sacrifice for looking nice. . That one is more of a personal style, the mobs were overall more tanky but with shorter detection range, so it makes sense they have to be tougher to prevent rushing down. I find it less stimulating because you have to approach the spawners to initiate combat, making it a more passive flow. While I have the tendency to make weaker mobs that die faster, but have a much bigger detection range, creating an engaging pressure to deal with. But that’s how tastes work. . The conclusion might sound negative overall, but that’s because I pointed out the flaws in priority. Feedback is important to figure out what worked and what didn’t. And with this, I can safely say that it is an impressive second map, and that overscope will be booted far away for the future. Savor it so you don’t burn your tongue. .",

            "title": "What is a CTM?",
            "content": "CTM stands for Complete The Monument, and originated from quite a long time ago. . They are Minecraft maps where you have to complete a monument as a goal. It started with having to obtain 16 wool blocks in their respective areas and placing them in a monument, but is now declined in various ways. It doesn’t have to be items, nor does it need to have a solid monument to complete. There are even some CTMs made in other games; At this point it is simply a genre of doing something with a goal to accomplish. . But the most common ones stay in a fairly standard format with global rules. You’ll be playing in Survival Mode, with no cheating and variable rules. The rest is usually fair game, using what you’re given the way you want. . The more modern maps have a tendency to become closer to action adventure with customized gear and enemies, capitalizing on datapacks for even more elaborate mechanics. There are as many styles as there are mapmakers and the diversity makes it truly a unique genre. . The best place to find them is the CTM repository. Maintained and containing most of all the CTM maps ever made. . There is also a discord server for the CTM community to share and talk about CTM maps. .",
